            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Reader.</head>
            <p>THE true End of Printing Sermons, is to promote the Belief and Practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: Which muſt be at a low Ebb, while the Witty part of the World is Floating in <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm,</hi> and the Heavier ſinking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to down-right <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</hi> And This, I think, is ſo good an End in it ſelf, that it certainly needs no Excuſe. For I know not why any Man may not venture upon doing Good, without asking leave of the World,
<pb facs="tcp:60756:4"/>or Pleading the Importunity of Friends, or craving a Protection for it. All the Diſcouragement lies in the Difficulty there is in reaching this excellent End, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in this Singular and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Age; in which He is no Body almoſt that has not an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion by himſelf: And he is counted a very eaſie Man, that will reſign it to a ſtronger Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for being reduced to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or two, or convinc'd of a few untoward Conſequences of it. But however this be, I think it becomes the Miniſters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to perſwade Men (if it be poſſible) to be Wiſe and Happy; and while the Scriptures are of any Authority with them, to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them of the Truths which belong to their Eternal Peace.</p>
            <p>And this I can truly ſay, is the
<pb facs="tcp:60756:4"/>Deſign of the following Sermons: The two firſt of which are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſhew the great Difference there is between a ſtable and well-grounded Faith, and meer Confidence and Opinion; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which carried him through the greateſt Tryals and Difficulties, and the Preſumption of a Phariſee, which did as ſtrange things in their kind. For as <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith offered up his Son in Obedience to God: So <hi>Saul</hi> by the impulſe of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, Perſecuted the Children of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, and verily thought, till our Saviour called to him out of Heaven (as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel did to <hi>Abraham</hi>) that he was doing the Will of God, even when he was going to make a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of the Third and
<pb facs="tcp:60756:5"/>Fourth Sermons, is to repreſent the extream Danger of Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency under the Powerful means of Grace, and of Truſting to a late or Death-Bed Repentance. Theſe, I fear, are very Grating and Unpleaſant Subjects; But I the rather think they require the plainer dealing; and muſt needs ſay in reference to the Latter, that upon the Review, I cannot eſteem it any breach of Charity to have wreſted a Text (perhaps more frequently miſ-applyed than any other in the Goſpel) out of the hands of thoſe that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Fairly in poſſeſſion of it, and are apt (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of ſome others) to wreſt it to their Own Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The Fifth was delivered at a time, when great Endeavours were uſed to turn us out of the ſtreight
<pb facs="tcp:60756:5"/>Way to Heaven: Which gave occaſion to ſhew the Grounds of our Proteſtant Faith, and the great Advantages it has above the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in point of certainty: How much Reaſon we have to adhere to the Doctrine of our own Church, and to adorn it by the Purity of our Lives and Examples. And the Way to do this, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and recommended in the following Diſcourſe concerning our Improvement in all Chriſtian Vertues and Graces.</p>
            <p>And were we once perſwaded to govern our Lives by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Religion, we might juſtly hope to Enjoy them more, and perhaps much longer than we do: We ſhould think it no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to ſuffer thoſe, that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and Deſpitefully uſe us, to live out the ſhort term of Life,
<pb facs="tcp:60756:6"/>which God and Nature hath ſet them, and make better Uſe of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of our Own; to bring us to which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Temper, is the Deſign of the two laſt Sermons.</p>
            <p>As to the Compoſure of theſe few Diſcourſes, the Reader will find enough to exerciſe his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Ingenuity. All I can hope for is, That they may be ſerviceable in ſome meaſure to the Lovers of Truth, for whoſe ſakes they are Publiſhed; &amp; that the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be the more Pardonable, becauſe my Infirmities at preſent are ſuch as hinder the Diſcharge of the Ordinary Duties of my Function. God grant his Bleſſing to all Faithful Endeavours to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Truth, and Promote Peace and Piety.</p>

               <p>THE Author of this Epiſtle diſcourſeth in this Chapter of two Eminent Points of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the Nature of Divine Faith, and the mighty Power and Efficacy of it. In the firſt Verſe he calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a grounded Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60756:8"/>of things hoped for and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Conviction of things not ſeen;<note place="margin">ver. 3.5. &amp;c.</note> ſuch as the Creation of this, and the Exiſtence of a better World. And this ſhews the Nature of Faith, to lye in a firm Perſwaſion of Truths and Promiſes, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Teſtimony of God, and not upon any ſenſible Evidence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of them. And accordingly, the Holy Men whoſe Faith is ſo much magnifyed in this Chapter,<note place="margin">ver. 13.</note> are ſaid to have dyed in Faith, being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Promiſes, and having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them many Ages before the time was come for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. Then, for the Power and Efficacy of this Grace, the Apoſtle tells us what Tranſcendent things it has done in Ancient times, and that by vertue of it, the Elders obtained a good Report;<note place="margin">ver. 2.</note> by which he means, That the Great and Famous Actions Recorded of the Patriarchs and other Worthies in the Old Teſtament, were all owing to their Faith; by Faith they pleaſed God, bore up againſt the Malice of the World, ſubdued Kingdoms, and wrought Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60756:8"/>in deſpight of the greateſt Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and the higheſt Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Many Inſtances he gives us of theſe Noble Flights of Faith,; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which there is none in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects more remarkable than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Text: <hi>By Faith</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>when he was tryed, Offered up</hi> Iſaac; <hi>and he that Received the Promiſes offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his only begotten Son; Of whom it was ſaid, that in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things are obſervable in theſe Words:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Hardneſs of the Tryal which God made of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he commanded him to offer up <hi>Iſaac</hi> to Him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Iſſue of this Tryal, or the Victory of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith over all the Hardſhips and Diſcouragements which he met with in it. Both theſe were extraordinary, and being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our Inſtruction, will ſurely afford us very uſeful Reflections in reference to our Faith and Practice. I begin with the Firſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Hardneſs of the Tryal, which God put <hi>Abraham</hi> upon, for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60756:9"/>the Diſcovery of his Faith and affiance in him. The Text calls it a Tryal, which implies that God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Son; for had it been a Free-will Offering, without any Order or Direction from God (ſuch as the Heathen Oblations were, when they Sacrificed their Children to their Idols) it had been a plain and horrid Act of Murther. Nor was it neceſſary (as ſome have Fancied) to clear the Righteouſneſs of God and <hi>Abraham</hi> in this matter, that God ſhould diſpence with the Sixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, when he obliged the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch to kill his Son, becauſe it had been Murther to kill him without his Command: For that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as is plain by the caſe before us) Forbids only to Kill without Gods Authority; which <hi>Abraham</hi> never went about to do, and therefore needed no Diſpenſation for it. He had an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commiſſion from God, who is abſolute Lord of Life and Death, and never barrs his Prerogative by his Laws, and may therefore uſe his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as he pleaſes, and take away the Life of the moſt Innocent Perſon, as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60756:9"/>well by the Hand of a Father, and the Fire upon the Altar as by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the Air, by Lightning or Tempeſt, or any other Meſſenger of Death. And thus <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, that God Tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> and bid him go and offer his Son upon a certain Mountain in <hi>Moriah</hi> for a Burnt <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Gen.</hi> 22.1, 2. And herein lay the ſharpneſs of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Tryal, that either he muſt contend with God, and Diſpute his Authority, or do the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt thing that ever was done in the World to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>That we may the better underſtand the Caſe, let us conſider what it was that God demanded of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a Teſt of his ſincerity towards Him, and what plauſible Arguments a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his Circumſtances might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to frame againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, God commands him to Sacrifice his Son, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more ſurprizing, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to him. Who ever heard of ſuch an Act of Piety before, of ſo hard a Precept, or ſo Unlikely a way of pleaſing God as this? What would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60756:10"/>an ordinary Faith have done, how would natural Reaſon have Pleaded in this caſe? Might not <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf be ſuppoſed to reaſon thus? Muſt I then lay aſide all Humanity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue my Hands in the Blood of my Own Son? Muſt I forget that I am a Father, and Deſtroy the Life which I gave? Does not Nature teach us to be Kind and Dutiful towards the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of our own Bowels? And are not the Laws of Nature Engraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Minds by the Finger of God himſelf? Has not the Reaſon which God has given me, hither to condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Action which he now Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? And tho' I know he is always Juſt and Good, and would do always that which I know would Pleaſe him, yet how can I hope to Pleaſe him by Deſtroying his Image in my own Child? What will the World ſay of me, who profeſs to Worſhip God in the pureſt manner, ſhould I Pollute his Altars with my Sons Blood, and do that ſtrange and unaccountable thing, which muſt needs be a Scandal to his Holy Religion? So harſh a command as this was enough to put, not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60756:10"/>only, but Faith it ſelf upon the ſtretch; and being perfectly New and Arbitrary, to fright Men from the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which this Holy Man had been the Beſt Example, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Promoter of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then, God did not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Abraham</hi> to Sacrifice his Son, but his Beloved and Only Son <hi>Iſaac, i. e.</hi> his only Son by <hi>Sarah</hi> the Free-Woman, and true Mother of the Family, which was to convey an Univerſal Bleſſing to Mankind. <hi>Take now thy Son</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>thine only Son</hi> Iſaac,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.2.</note> 
                  <hi>whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the Land of</hi> Moriah, <hi>and offer him there for a Burnt Offering.</hi> And this greatly increaſes the difficulty of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Obedience, that it ſhould pleaſe God to demand; not one out of many, but his Only Son, his <hi>Iſaac</hi> whom he intirely loved, the only Joy of his Mother, and the only hope of the Family, which was to make the beſt figure of any other in the World. And now might not <hi>Abraham</hi> have ſaid, Lord, muſt I bereave my ſelf of the Child, which nothing but a Miracle of thine could raiſe out of my Aged Loins? Muſt I take away a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60756:11"/>Life, for which I would gladly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change my own? Will not all my Flocks and Herds afford an Acceptable Sacrifice to thee? All theſe I would freely offer, inſtead of that Innocent Lamb, in which all my Earthly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Comfort lies. <hi>Let not the Lord be angry, and I will ſpeak this once: Is not the Life of</hi> Sarah <hi>bound up in the Life of the Child?</hi> How ſhall I anſwer the Death of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to her? Or muſt I be the Inſtrument of two ſuch Deaths at once, and when I have ſlain the Son, carry the Killing Tidings to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Mother? Oh how great a ſtreight was this Good Man driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to! when he muſt either have forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Favour of God, or bereaved himſelf of all that was Dear to him in this World, by the ſtrangeſt act of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that was ever heard of in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another grand Diſcouragement to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Obedience was, that his Beloved <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a Son of very great and glorious Promiſes, which his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Death muſt, without a Miracle, fruſtrate the completion of. For God had promiſed to make him the Father of a numerous Off-ſpring, and that in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60756:11"/>him ſhould all the Nations of the Earth be Bleſſed. And 'tis certain, That Gods Command to <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Son, was not more expreſs than his Promiſe concerning that very Son, of whom it was ſaid, <hi>That in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this ſtarts a new Difficulty: For now the Queſtion ſeems to be, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> was more obliged to obey Gods Injunction, than to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Promiſes; which would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuggeſt ſuch thoughts to him as theſe. God has given me a Son, and in him a Promiſe of a bleſſed Seed, and a numerous Poſterity; If I execute his command, what will his promiſe ſignify? Shall <hi>Iſaac</hi> become a Father, when I have made him a Sacrifice? when I have taken away his Life in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, will he ſend him back to me? Surely if he deſigned to do this, He that has been ſo gratious as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf upon ſeveral occaſions to me, would not hide ſo great and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Secret from me. 'Tis true, God has an unqueſtionable Right to my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but then he is pleaſed to give me a Right in his Promiſe: And ſince
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60756:12"/>He is not a Man that he ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and ſince his promiſe was ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to his Command, may I not Interpret his Command by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? And infer from hence, that whatever Tryal he is pleaſed to put me upon, yet having Promiſed to bleſs <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and all Nations in his Seed, he does not really chuſe that I ſhould vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Precious Life, and ſo ſtop the current of his future and choiſeſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to Mankind. But beſides theſe perplexities,</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Abraham</hi> had this diſadvantage more, that Gods command required a ſpeedy Execution: So that he had little or no time to ſettle his thoughts about it, and to ſuppreſs thoſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which we muſt allow to be very Natural in his Caſe. <hi>Take now thy Son</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>thine only Son Iſaac.</hi>— A ſhort warning for a man to part with an Only Son, eſpecially one ſo endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divine Favours, and Promiſes as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, and in that ſevere man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that <hi>Abraham</hi> was obliged to do. A ſmall time for a Tender-hearted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to overcome the ſtruggle between Faith and Nature, which it is hard to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60756:12"/>think the Father of the Faithful could be on this Occaſion exempted from. And this makes the caſe much harder on <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſide, that he had but very little time to recollect himſelf, to quiet his Paternal Affections, and to ſettle his mind upon a Subject, ſo every way Entangled with Difficulties, and that required ſo much fineneſs and ſtrength of Thoughts to clear his way through, and to come to a perfect Reſolution with himſelf about it. So that on all accounts, this Tryal of <hi>Abraham</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be one of the ſoreſt and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Tryals which God ever Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon any of his Faithful Servants.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Second thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The Iſſue of this Tryal, or the Victory of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Faith over all the Hardſhips and Diſcouragements he met with in it. And here I ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly conſider theſe two Partioulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Compleatneſs of this Victory, and</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Power or Principle by which it was wronght.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By Faith</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, when he was tryed, Offered up</hi> Iſaac.</p>
               <p>I. For the firſt of theſe, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60756:13"/>of the Victory, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it lay in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Command of God with an Undaunted Reſolution, in deſpight of the Difficulties he was ſurrounded with, to which he proceeded by theſe following ſteps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He immediately applyed himſelf to the Performance of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. When God had once declared his pleaſure to him, 'tis ſaid, he Roſe up early in the Morning, and having made all things ready for a Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.3</note> began his Journey to <hi>Moriah;</hi> which ſhews that he had a very quick and lively ſenſe of his Duty to God in all Caſes: And that what ever Tryal it might pleaſe God to make of him, he was provided for it before hand, and was not to be ſurprized by the moſt daſhing or ſevere Injunction. And in this he was an admirable Pattern to the Servants of God in all Ages, of the greateſt perfection which in this life they are capable of: I mean, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Readineſs and diſpoſition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign up themſelves entirely to him, and to part freely with the very Choiceſt Bleſſings he is pleaſed to enrich them with.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60756:13"/>
               <p n="2">2. He uſes all the Prudence and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Tenderneſs of the Caſe did require. He keeps the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to himſelf, leaſt by taking Air, and coming to the knowledge of his Wife or Son, it ſhould awaken thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in them, which might tempt him to forego his Reſolution. He gets up early in the Morning,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.3.5, 8.</note> takes <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Son and two of his Servants with him: Them he leaves at a convenient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, leaſt they ſhould obſtruct his Deſign, and Him he leads on to the Place of Worſhip, telling him that God would provide himſelf a Lamb, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing which ſeem'd to be wanting for a Burnt-Offering. Thus he carries the matter with all immaginable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage towards the Execution of his purpoſe; He keeps the ſecret from her that lay in the ſame Boſom with it; he makes no complaints of the Hardſhips he was put upon, Faſtens no parting Kiſs upon his Dying <hi>Iſaac,</hi> nor betrays his Sad Intention, or any Reluctancy within himſelf, ſo much as by a ſingle Sigh or Tear. And what more could the moſt Affectionate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do, to ſave the Life of a beloved
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60756:14"/>and only Son, than <hi>Abraham,</hi> out of pure Obedience to Gods Command, did to compaſs the Death of his? But more than this,</p>
               <p n="3">3. He carried on his Obedience to the utmoſt point of Perfection. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Knife was in his Hand, his Son lay panting upon the Altar, and he was juſt giving the deadly ſtroke when the Angel called to him out of Heaven to ſtay his Hand,<note place="margin">Gen. 22, 9, 10, 11.</note> which if he had not done, he had certainly in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſent <hi>Iſaac</hi> thither. So that there was nothing wanting in <hi>Abrahams</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with God in all that he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him. He perfectly Reſigned up his Will to him. He weaned himſelf from every thing that was dear to him in this World: He offered up his very <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſo far, that there was but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between him and Death; and by that wonderful Act gave ſuch a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Piety and entire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God, as procured this Glorious Teſtimony from him, <hi>Now know I that thou feareſt me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ſince thou haſt not witheld thy Son, thine Only Son from me.</hi> To all which may be added,</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this good Man never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murred
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60756:14"/>or faultered all the while he was upon his Tryal. One would think it was impoſſible for him to go through ſo ſevere a Task without repining at ſome or other of the Diffioulties impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon him. One of us would be very apt to Fancy, that every time he caſt his Eye upon his Son, and Talkt with him upon the Way to <hi>Moriah,</hi> Nature ſhould make a ſtand, and his Heart ſhould fail him, to think what a ſad Uncomfortable Errand he was going upon. But we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this in <hi>Abrahams</hi> deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during the whole proceſs of his Tryal; He did not make a falſe ſtep in three Days Journey to <hi>Moriah:</hi> He was ſo far from ſtaggering at the ſtrangeneſs of things, that he went on without delay, (and as far as appears by the Hiſtory of this great Action) proceeded by even and conſtant ſteps, through all the Stages of his Tedious Duty.<note place="margin">Gen. 22.9.</note> Even when he came to the Mountain which God told him of, had built an Altar, and laid the Wood in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon it, he did not ſo much as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low himſelf to ſay, muſt I now Burn the ſtaff of my Old-Age, and the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60756:15"/>Pledge of Gods Favour to me and all Ages of the World? So that we ſee, he perfectly overcame the Difficulties, and ſurmounted the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, which his way was obſtructed with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Power or Principle by which this Tranſcendent Act of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was wrought, <hi>i. e.</hi> by which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> Prevailed with himſelf, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Diſcouragements, to offer up <hi>Iſaac.</hi> The Apoſtle aſcribes it to his Faith: Now Faith we know, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for an habitual Belief or Perſwaſion of the Perfections, Truths, and Promiſes of God, and ſometimes for a ſingle Act of this eminent Grace: and there are places, of which the Text is one, in which it is apparently Uſed in both ſenſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, the honour of this Noble Action was owing to a conſtant and habitual Perſwaſion of Divine Truths and Promiſes, which <hi>Abraham</hi> had attained unto. He had been long accuſtomed to believe God upon his Word, and to rely upon his Truth and Faithfulneſs: And being fully perſwaded of the Reality and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60756:15"/>of all that he Revealed to him, it was eaſie for him to conclude and ſettle upon this great Principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>that God in all things was to be Obeyed.</hi> And this Perſwaſion was the Root of all his Piety and Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Will of God. Upon this he left his own Country for a ſtrange Land, and followed the Clue of God's Providence whitherſoever it led him; it directed his ſteps when he knew not whither he went, and put him into a poſture of Undertaking the Hardeſt Tryals, and giving any proof of his Sincerity that God ſhould demand of him. And accordingly when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Son, the Deareſt thing he had in the World, tho' it was againſt the Law of Nature in any Caſe but his, to ſlay an Innocent Youth: Tho it was in common eſteem a Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the Kindneſs and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which a Fathers Name carries in it, and no leſs contrary to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments of the Conjugal Relation: Nay, though it had all the Viſible Marks of Unnatural Rage and Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity upon it, and was like to prove an Indelible Blemiſh to Religion; tho'
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60756:16"/>theſe conſiderations were no leſs Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious than Weighty, yet was <hi>Abraham</hi> (through the Conſtancy of his Faith and Obedience) ſo Naturaliz'd to the Service of God, that nothing could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from it.</p>
               <p>But I confeſs this does not fully clear the main Difficulty implyed in the Text, <hi>Viz.</hi> That <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould offer up his Son by Faith, while he Believed the Promiſes concerning his Seed, it being againſt common Senſe or Reaſon, That if <hi>Iſaac</hi> dyed without Iſſue, His Seed ſhould be Bleſſed after him. So that <hi>Abraham</hi> might be a ſtrong Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and do great things by his Faith, yet ſtill it does not appear but that he muſt needs ſtagger, while he ſhook the very Ground and Foundation which his Faith and Hope had reſted upon, as he did when he went about to deſtroy the promiſed Line, and ſo Cut off all the Bleſſings that depended upon it. Let us therefore have recourſe to the ſecond Notion of Faith, and Conſider it as it ſignifies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some ſpecial and Eminent Act of this Grace: And ſuch we find in the preſent caſu, namely a ſtrong Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60756:16"/>of <hi>Abraham</hi> of the Power of God to raiſe up <hi>Iſaac</hi> from the dead. And to this the context expreſly aſcribes his ſucceſs: By faith <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was tried, offered up <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 19.1.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that God was able to raiſe him up even from the dead; i. e.</hi> that he had Power to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his Promiſe by bringing <hi>Iſaac</hi> to Life again, and that he would certainly do it, rather than ſuffer the leaſt tittle of his promiſe to Dye with him. And now his Way, tho' hard, was clear and open; and there was nothing to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his Obedience but what his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Faith could deal withal. He had doubtleſs conſidered, that God had a better Intereſt in his Son, and all his other Poſſeſſions, than any he could lay claim unto: And the great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he had for his Wiſdom and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, Huſh't his Natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and whereas God's Command ſeem'd to Oppoſe his promiſes, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame the Difficulty too, Believing that God was able to Reconcile them, and bring back <hi>Iſaac</hi> from the Dead by the ſame Power that gave him his Firſt Being, when he ſprang from One (as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60756:17"/>is obſerved in this Chapter) that was as Good as Dead, that is Himſelf that had Out-lived the Natural Power of giving Life to others.</p>
               <p>We ſee then the Eminency of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Faith,<note place="margin">v. 12.</note> and the ſupport it gave him all along in his Tryal. By the Direction of it he kept his Eye all the while upon God's Command, and-Wink't at all the ſeeming contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that Oppos'd his Obedience to it. He doubted not but that God had Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Kill, and to make alive: To Command what he pleaſed, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe that Diligently Seek and Obey him. In ſhort, amidſt all the hard things that bore upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, there was nothing appeared ſo Incredible to him, as that God ſhould lye, or ſo unreaſonable as to ſuſpend his Obedience while he was Perſuaded of God's Faithfulneſs to him; And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he immediately followed him in the Light and ſtrength of his Faith, without any Faultering or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret; through all the Dark Scenes of that Cloudy Providence, which led him to the Sacrifice of his Only Son: And that after a moſt Expreſs and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60756:17"/>Promiſe, that in <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Seed ſhould be called.</p>
               <p>And now 'tis time for us to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how far we are concerned in this Diſcourſe, both in reference to our Faith and Practice. <hi>Firſt</hi> then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence we Learn the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Juſtifying Faith, there being nothing plainer in Scripture, than that <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith was Imputed to him for Righteouſneſs, which certainly it had never been, if he had not Obeyed the Command which was the Tryal of his Faith. If <hi>Abraham</hi> then was Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by the Faith which offered up his Son, 'tis clear, that he was juſtifyed by a lively and working Faith. And that no other Faith than this can Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify, is evident if we conſider, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith is more than once Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in Scripture as the great Pattern and Exemplar of the Faith which Juſtifies, and that the Great Commendation of it lies in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence it had upon the Holineſs and Obedience of his Life. And then, if we have not the ſame kind of Faith, that is, a Faith which makes us O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the Will of God, we have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60756:18"/>not that true and genuine Faith which Juſtifies. And therefore if we Believe, but do not obey the Truth, we muſt needs fall as ſhort of the Favour of God as we do of the Faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For to ſpeak freely, I cannot underſtand what Uſe there is of Faith, but to quicken us to do the Will of God, in order to our obtaining his Favour; And if this be the proper and only good Uſe of Faith, it follows, that if we ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Faith from Holineſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it loſes all the Virtue which it hath to Juſtify us: And then, if we are never ſo Orthodox in Points of Faith, what does it Profit, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Can that Faith ſave us, which cannot procure our accptance with God? Have not all Wicked Men that Believe the Truths of Chriſtianity the ſame?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Nay the Devils</hi> (as St. <hi>James</hi> obſerves) <hi>Tremble</hi> under as good a Faith as this.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſtrange therefore, that any Man of Competent Reaſon ſhould think that a Dry and Barren Faith, a Volatil notion in the Head, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Reaches the Heart and Life, ſhould put him into the happieſt ſtate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60756:18"/>that he can poſſibly attain to in this Life; Or that which makes him never the better Man, ſhould yet make him the Favourite of God; That a Dead and Uſeleſs Faith ſhould do him the greateſt Kindneſs in the World, and Intitle him to Life Eternal.</p>
               <p>Now if Juſtifying Faith be more than an Aſſent to Truth, if beſides this it be a Vital Principle of Vertue and Holineſs, we ſee what a perfect Dream the <hi>Antinomian Doctrine</hi> of Juſtification from Eternity is. For ſurely no Man was Juſtifyed by Faith ſo long ago, as from Eternity: And if we were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed from Eternity, our Faith comes too late to juſtify us, and then there can be no ſuch thing as juſtifying Faith. And this the Patrons of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion do not diſſemble in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of Faith, in which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it as a means only of Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting and Applying to themſelves their Perſonal juſtification from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And is not this a fair ſtep to the laying aſide of the whole Goſpel? For let any Impartial Man judge, what effect the Great Precepts and Motives of the Goſpel are like to have upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60756:19"/>thoſe Men that conceive they have but one thing to do, to ſatisfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are in a juſtified ſtate, and that is to Believe Roundly that they were ſo from Eternity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are taught by this Tryal not to ſtagger or Repine, at any ſharp or Myſterious Providences, but to look upon them as the Wiſe Methods of God to prove our Sincerity, and to exerciſe our Faith in him. Of all the Excellent Men in Scripture, there is none that was honoured with more Eminent Tokens of Divine Favour and Acceptance, than <hi>Abraham</hi> was. He was ſtyled the Friend of God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithful Seed, and the Heir of the World:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13.</note> He was Familiarly Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by Angels from Heaven, and Dignify'd with many ſpecial Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and glorious Promiſes; He was the Keeper of Gods Secrets,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.17</note> one whom he declared his Confidence in: Yea, was ſo Highly in his Favour, that God engaged himſelf by a Covenant with him to preſerve true Religion in his Family in all future Ages, and gave him a Proſpect of the Day of Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.56.</note> at almoſt two thouſand Years Diſtance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60756:19"/>from it. And beſides this Inſtance, it has been no Unuſual thing with God to ſingle out the Beſt men for the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Tryals, and to propoſe them as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Faith and <hi>Patience</hi> to their own and all ſucceeding Generations, as appears by the reſt of the Worthies of this Chapter, and the beſt Hiſtories of all Ages. Now ſhall we call this an Errour of Providence, and conclude that all theſe Excellent Men were caſt out of Gods Favour and Protection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he call'd them to ſuch Noble Tryals for the Honour and Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Faith? If not, we can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing either againſt our ſelves, (while we ſtudy to pleaſe God) or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Equity and goodneſs of his Providence, from the Troubles and Perplexities of this preſent Life, how extraordinary ſoever they may be for the Nature or Circumſtances of them. We ſhould conſider rather, that good Men are the fitteſt to ſerve the Great ends of Providence, and to teach the World Submiſſion to the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, by their Afflictions and Tryals: And this clears at once the Wiſdom and goodneſs of God in thus
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60756:20"/>training them up for thoſe exceſſive Heights of Glory, which are prepared in Heaven for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Carriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> in this Tryal may ſerve to convince the World that there is ſuch a thing as Living by Faith; that is, ſerving God without Reſpect to Worldly Advantages, nay in view of the greateſt Loſſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments that can be ſuſtained by it. The looſer part of Mankind has been always very apt to charge the ſincere with pretending Religion for ſecular ends. Being willing to eaſe themſelves of the ſhame of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Impious Lives, they would faign have the World believe, that there is no ſuch thing as true Faith and Piety: That 'tis nothing but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, that gives ſome men the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of being better than others: And that the Beſt love the World at their Hearts, as dearly as thoſe that Proclaim their Paſſion for it, and profeſſedly make their Court to it. And the truth is, it has coſt the Servants of God ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dear in their ſeveral Ages, to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the World in this matter, and to Vindicate the Honour of Religion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60756:20"/>againſt the Scoffs and Infidelity of Men. For I doubt not but one ſpecial end of the Tryals and Sufferings of Good Men, is to convince the World that Religion is a Reality, and that there are thoſe that chearfully ſerve God upon the Faith and Hope of a Better Life, yea, tho' it coſt them their very deareſt Delights and Comforts in this. The Example in the Text is a Demonſtration of this beyond all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Evaſion or Anſwer. And ſince <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children have the ſame Kind of Faith, which he himſelf was ſo Renowned for, I mean a Faith which carries them through the ſervice of God, in Purſuit of a Heavenly Country, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which hath Foundations, this vindicates all True Believers to the end of Time, from the Foul charge of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and doing their Works to be feen of Men. 'Tis the Character of their Family, <hi>That they Believe him that is Inviſible: That they live by Faith and not by Senſe, and are all of them Men and Women, of the ſame Spirit and Ingenuity, tho' not in the ſame Perfection that</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60756:21"/>
                  <hi>was.</hi> And that there is, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will be ſuch a Family in the Earth, is as evident as the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when the Church was impaled in his little Family, and ten Promiſe of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to His,, <hi>That the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> And therefore they that are, and know that they are ſincere, have no reaſon to value the Cenſures of Men. 'Tis enough that they ſeek to pleaſe God, and that he Knows their Integrity; for God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely; and if we are ſincere, he cannot Judge otherwiſe of us: and then we are ſafe; our Reward is ſure, and will be great in Heaven. We need not ask leave of Men to be what we are, or ſtand to their Courteſy to bring us into Favour with him that Judgeth Righteouſly; 'Tis enough in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, That God and our Conſciences are Ready to Acquit us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, The ſucceſs of this Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſhould Inſpire us with Zeal and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to ſerve and pleaſe God in all inſtances of Obedience to him. There is no Duty too hard for a vigorous and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60756:21"/>Lively Faith: There is none but what the Servants of God have diſcharged before us. And when we reflect upon what our great Examples have done, and conſider how nobly they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted themſelves in the ſame Race that is ſet before us, why ſhould we not aſpire to be as brave and Reſolute as they were; and to break through the Diſcouragements which could not hinder them from Running and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Courſe with Joy? Did they Climb over the higheſt Difficulties? And may not we be aſhamed to couch under the ordinary hardſhips in Religion? Did they depend upon God, when nothing but Miracles could Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their hopes in him? And ſhall we diſtruſt his goodneſs and Protection while we actually enjoy them, and he is pleas'd to continue ſo many Viſible Tokens of his Favour and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us? Did they leave their Country at God's Command? And ſhall we think it too much but to leave the Vices of ours, which have long threatned to turn us out of Poſſeſſion of it? Again, did they ſtick at nothing to pleaſe God, not ſo much as at the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60756:22"/>Offering of an Only Son? And ſhall we that have Better Promiſes than they had, Refuſe him ſo Reaſonable a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as to offer up our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in holy Flames of Devotion and Love, which is the perfect and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Will of God, and therefore muſt be extreamly acceptable to him.</p>
               <p>'Tis ture, <hi>That without Faith it is Impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> But ſure it is not Impoſſible to Believe, and ſo by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our Faith to obey and pleaſe him; For this is the Argument of the whole Diſcourſe in this Chapter, which out of the Sacred Annals of the Primitive Church, preſents us with a Catalogue of many Eminent Believers, who became the favourites of God by their Faith and Obedience to him. And what is the Natural conſequence of this? But that we, who have the ſame and in ſome Reſpects much greater Advantages than they had, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew the ſame greatneſs of Mind, and Invincible Reſolution in Gods Service?</p>
               <p>To Conclude, we have an Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Pattern of Faith and Piety in the Text, <hi>Abraham</hi> the Friend of God,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60756:22"/>laying himſelf at his Foot, and his Son upon his Altar, in Obedience to his Soveraign Will and Pleaſure. How much more ſhould we at Gods Command Sacrifice our Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Luſts, that would deſtroy our Souls, ſince one of the two muſt dye? And this is a Sacrifice much cheaper, and no leſs Acceptable to God than <hi>Abrahams</hi> Oblation was:<note place="margin">Micah. 6.7, 8.</note> More grateful to him than <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouſands of Rams, or ten thouſand Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Oyl, Than if thou gaveſt thy Firſt-born for thy Tranſgreſſion, the Fruit of thy Body for the ſin of thy Soul:</hi> Offer this as the Firſt fruits of thy Faith, without which, thy very <hi>Prayers will be turned into ſin.</hi> Then ſhalt thou have favour in the ſight of God, through the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sacrifice of his only Son; and by walking before him as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, may'ſt aſſuredly hope, after a ſhort Tryal of thy Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this World, to ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Faithful in the Kingdom of God.</p>

               <p>THESE Words are part of the Confeſſion of an Eminent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the Chriſtian Religion, A man of Learning and Zeal, and Conſcience:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60756:24"/>that had the Benefits of a Religious Education, and of great natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, and that made a more than an ordinary figure both in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church. In the former he was a Ring-leader of the Sect of the Phariſees: A Sect, which perhaps till the Days of <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> never had its equal in the World. And as the Phariſees of any party among the Jews were known to be the keeneſt againſt the Chriſtians, ſo he owns himſelf to have been as errant a Phariſee, as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and as eager a Perſecutor, as any of his Order.<note place="margin">ver. 10.11.</note> He was the Man by his own Confeſſion, that ſhut up many of the Saints in Priſon, and when they were put to Death for their Religion, he gave his Voice againſt them. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he Puniſht often in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and compell'd them to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme <hi>i.e.</hi> to Renounce their Faith in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Plin. Ep. Tra. de Christian</note> and to Curſe him: Uſing the ſame Cruelty towards them which the Heathen Governours afterwards did; and thoſe that refuſed this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Treachery to their Lord, he Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted into ſtrange, that is, Heathen Cities. Theſe things were contracy in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60756:24"/>deed (and one would think ſhould be always ſo eſteem'd) to the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. But there is one thing in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Confeſſion which appears to be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than all this: And that is, that it was his Judgment and Conſcience that made him thus ſevere to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and his Zeal to God and Religion that rais'd the Perſecution againſt them. It was it ſeems the prevailing ſenſe of his Mind, a Caſe he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined within himſelf, that he ought to run down the Religion of Jeſus. So he tells the King and Court in theſe Words, <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the Name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A hearty Champion you ſee, he had been againſt the Chriſtian Religion: But how came he to fall into an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and to Eſpouſe a Principle, that the worſt Religion might well be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of? The true account of it is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> had been a Right-bred Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 23.6</note> having ſuckt in the Principles of that Superſtitious Sect in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and lived (till he became a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) exactly according to them, as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60756:25"/>he tells King <hi>Agrippa</hi> in the hearing of the Jews at the fifth Verſe of this Chapter. And therefore what he charges himſelf with, we are not to look upon as his own private perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only, but rather as an inſtance of the general ſentiment of the Men of his way, and indeed as the Natural brood and Iſſue of Phariſaical Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>By Superſtition I mean a groundleſs Apprehenſion of pleaſing God by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things which he never command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or forbearing thoſe which he hath no where Forbidden. And this was the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the great and leading Error of the Phariſees. They added to the written Word of God, and made more Duties and ſins than ever the Law had made. Their Traditions, which had nothing to recommend them but the Cuſtom of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they eſteemed equal at leaſt to the Divine Commandments; Nay our Saviour expreſly tells us, <hi>They made the Commandments of God of no effect by their Traditions;</hi> as if they thought to pleaſe him better in their own way than in His: And
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60756:25"/>Reckon'd they advanc'd themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, by what they did over and above their Duty, as much in his asthey did in their own Opinion And hence Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to their Traditional Rites, was their meaſure of Improvement and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Religion, as appears by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Character of himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>I profited in the Jews Religion above many of my Equals in my own Nation, being more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly Zealous of the Tradition of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Which words, if we obſerve their connexion with thoſe immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſeem to come in as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why <hi>beyond meaſure</hi> (as he there tells us) <hi>he Perſecuted the Church of God and wasted it; i.e.</hi> His mighty Zeal for the Unſcriptural Doctrines of the Phariſees, was the true ground of his Bitter and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Zeal againſt the Profeſſors of the True Religion. And this is the rather to be noted, becauſe it ſhews us the Spirit and Genius of that Sect, that had the chief hand in bringing our Saviour to his Croſs, and <hi>firſt conſpired</hi> the <hi>ruine</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Words thus explained, the matter I would crave leave to Propoſe to your ſerious conſiderations is this. That the Conſciences of Men may be ſo far

                  </gap>, <hi>to perform a grateful Service or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſice to God:</hi> As if they knew no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of pleaſing him, than by take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Lamb out of his own Flock, and making it an Oblation to him. Now
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60756:27"/>this is certainly a very ſtrange way of ſervig God, and ſuch as men would never have thought of, if they had not Deify'd ſomething more than him, and changed the Glory of the Holy and Merciful God into a direful Image of their own Temper and Complexion, whom they Worſhip inſtead of him. And as I doubt not but the Jews were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily intended in this Prophecy, ſo to the Infinite Scandal of Chriſtianity, there is unanſwerable Reaſon to think that many that ſhelter themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sacred Profeſſion of it, are very deeply concerned in it; ſure I am, that all the Marks of this Prophecy, the ſame Religious zeal, expreſt by the ſame rage, rancour, and cruelty, are very freſh and eaſie to be ſeen upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By many plain and Undeniable Inſtances Parallel to that we meet with in the Text. The Apoſtles Confeſſion was indeed a ſinular thing, But for the Crimes which he taxeth himſelf with, he might as juſtly have charged his Nation with them, the main Body of the Jewiſh Church, eſpecially the governing part of it, being ſtrangely Leavened with this Sowre and Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60756:27"/>zeal. <hi>They had a zeal for God</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf Teſtifies of them) <hi>but not according to knowledge;</hi> for they knew not his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence Goodneſs and Benignity to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor his only begotten Son, when he was amongſt them. They had a zeal for the Law, but ſo they preſumed to call what ever they had made Law by their Gloſſes and Traditions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected it againſt thoſe that had a zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. And a very fierce and fatal zeal it was; A zeal that Crucifyed the Lord of Life: That threw the Apoſtles into Priſons, That cleared the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of them and their Diſciples: That Crampt and Loaded them with Chains and Fetters, and for a <hi>good work</hi> gave forty Stripes ſave one. A zeal that ſuborned Witneſſes, and breathed out Threatnings and ſlaughter againſt Men of whom the World was not worthy; a zeal that liſted Men into Conſpiracies, and bound them under an Oath to Kill an Innocent Perſon. An outragious zeal it was, that made Men exceedingly Mad, as one that had too much experience of it, tells us (<hi>v. 11th.</hi> of this Chapter) ſo mad, as to think they <hi>ought to d many things contrary to the cleareſt Revelations of God and the Name of</hi> Jeſus.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60756:28"/>
               <p>Nor is this kind of Zeal Peculiar to the temper of the Jewiſh Nation. There are thoſe in the World, that would be thought the only Good Chriſtians, who roundly Excommunicate all other Churches for not complying with their Dictates as eſſentiael to Chriſtianity, which the Scripturs and the next Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and venerable Writings do aſſure us are not. There are thoſe that call us He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, (and have often proved us ſo, as clearly as Fire and Faggot can do it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſo ſtrait-laced as to Believe but juſt ſo many Truths and Articles of Faith, as were at firſt delivered to the Saints: And are ſo Nice and Humorous as not to Believe the flatteſt contradictions to them. There is a Church that for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages, and in ſeveral Councils, hath Decreed the Extirpation of Hereticks (<hi>i.e.</hi> the moſt Orthodox Chriſtians) by Fire and Sword, and fairly Recommended it as an Eminent Teſt of Catholick Zeal. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (at leaſt) there have been, who with mighty Confidence pretended to ſecret motions and Immediate Warrants from Heaven, to Worry and Deſtroy all that ſhould withſtand them and their <hi>Doctrin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might tire you with inſtances of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60756:28"/>both kinds, and make it appear that the Zeal of Chriſtians againſt One another hath in point of Fierceneſs and Cruelty, far exceeded the Pattern in the Text.</p>
               <p>For the Proof of this, I might but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to take a ſhort Review of the Ruines which Romiſh Zeal, hath made in Proteſtant Countries, from our own to the very borders of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. To keep neareſt home; I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Holy League of <hi>France</hi> for the Utter Extirpation of the Reform'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And to the Barbarous Uſage of more than many Thouſand Chriſtians in the United Provinces,<note place="margin">Grot. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>lib. 1.</hi>
                  </note> I mean, before the Quarrel began with the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I might refer you to Inquiſitions, Invaſions and Maſſacres; to the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zeal of the <hi>Marian</hi> days, and the Powder Conſpiracy here in <hi>England,</hi> that Maſter-piece of Inhumanity, deſign'd, no doubt, to make amends for the long Peace and Tranquility we enjoyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pious and gentle Reign of our Immortal Virgin Queen. After theſe, it were cold and endleſs to mention all the Impious and Unnatural Artifices of the Agents of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the Lives of our Princes, the felicity of our Government,<note place="margin">Foulis Hiſt. of Romiſh Treaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurp.</note>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60756:29"/>and the Vitals of our Religion. One thing in the general you may obſerve, that when ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath loſt any thing by dint of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ſhe hath preſently betaken her ſelf to ſharper and deadlier Weapons for the Recovery of it. And methinks it is the leaſt of Wonders, that a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Pamper'd with Power and Wealth and Honours, that thinks her ſelf fit to give Law to the whole Chriſtian World, and that it is her Unqueſtionable Right and Duty by all poſſible means to do it, ſhould not wave her Principles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her ſelf to admoniſh and Weep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Obſtinate Hereticks, (as our Bleſſed Lord did over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>), when her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns call for Blood and Cruelty, and 'tis apparent that Men will not be made O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient without them. On the other hand, there has been another ſort of men that under pretence of Refining the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation have ſhamefully violated the Pure and Undefiled Religion that came from Heaven. And for this, I might refer you to the Wicked Outrages of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts</hi> at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and the Terrible Battles which have been fought for little Phanſies, and affected ſingularities in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60756:29"/>Religion. I might call to your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the many Inſurrections, and (what I even Tremble to ſpeak of) the horrid Murther of the late Arch-Biſhop in <hi>Scotland.</hi> I might deſire you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the fierce and bloody At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, which in our Memory and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been managed upon the <hi>fifth Monarchy Principles.</hi> In a word, I might carry you to the Tombs of Kings, Nobles, and Prelates, of worthy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots and Miniſters of Juſtice, of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Ambaſſadors of Peace, who by hands lifted up to Heaven, have been offered (to uſe the Apoſtles Phraſe) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacrifice and Service of your <hi>Faith, which ſome call Hereſie, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which we now Worſhip the God of our Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to apply theſe Alluſions to the purpoſe of the Text, I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to you, that the chief Actors and Parties in them have at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confeſt, that they verily thought they were engaged in a good Cauſe; many Apologies have been made, and many volumes have been written for them; Yea, many have ſealed it with their Blood, and pronounc't it with their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60756:30"/>laſt breath, that the things they did, and Dyed for, as ill as they look'd towards the World, were done out of Zeal to God and Religion; that is, they <hi>thonght they ought to have done them,</hi> as contrary and Diſhonourable as they really were, to the Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now in the ſecond place,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſhew whece it is that Men are liable to be thus Miſguided by Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Principles, and Tranſported with this Extravagant and deſtructive Zeal. I confeſs, 'tis very natural to men to be warm and zealous for their own Doctrines and Sentimests, ill ſo much that they that have the Truth on their ſide, have not always the Charity and Good-Nature that ſhould attend it. But that this Inclination ſhould ſo mightily raiſe the Spleen, and fire the Spirits of Men: That it ſhould grow ſo violent, Quarrelſome, and Impetuous, as to <hi>ſcorn</hi> the Reſtraint of Laws both Divine and Humane, and break down all the Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Government, to ſet up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fo Chriſt, <hi>which is not of this World;</hi> That the Diſciples of ſo meek a Maſter as our Saviour was, and the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of ſo Charitable and obliging, ſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60756:30"/>Holy and Healing an Inſtitution as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is, ſhould think themſelves Bound to promote every Crude Opinion with the Sword, Nay, that inſpired and (as they call themſelves) <hi>Infallible</hi> Men, ſhould be ſo much out of the way, ſo exceedingly fierce, and angry with all that are not of their Minds, as to devote them to Preſent and Eternal Ruine: Theſe things are ſo extreamly full of Scandal and Contradiction, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Demonſtration of the Truth, it were ſcarce Charity to believe the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of them. But let us do that Right to Chriſtianity and our ſelves, as to ſee where the fault lyes, and what it is that under the pretence of Conſcience, has wrought ſo much Miſery and Coufuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>To aſſign all the cauſes of theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, would require more Time and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience than the preſent occaſion will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I ſhall therefore confine my ſelf to ſuch as I think have the greateſt Intereſt in them, and are beſt able to anſwer for them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is Bad Education: which has a ſtrange Influence upon the Spirits and Perſuaſions of Men, and is able to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60756:31"/>change the ſweeteſt natural Diſpoſitions into the Bittereſt and fierceſt Tempers. The great Spring and Mover of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions in the Judgment of the Mind, and therefore the firſt Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Judgment, which is the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Education, muſt have a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtroke in the Conduct of the Life of Man; and the rather becauſe the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions we receive of things, while our Minds are free from all ſuſpition and Prejudice, are commonly the Deepeſt moſt laſting and indelible. And hence it is, that Men are generally very apt to ſtick to their firſt Principles, be they true or falſe, and for want of due enquiry how they came by them, to take them for Divine Impreſſions and Eternal Truths. And thus an Erroneous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Uſurps the Authority of a Guide, the ordinary effect of which, is a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Oppoſition againſt all that ſtandin its way, or preſume to Check and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the Dictates of it. For what ever ought to be, it is plain that Mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Thoughts and Principles are and will be the Rule of their Actions; and that the worſe any Principles are, and the Earlier they are Inſtilled into them,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60756:31"/>under the Notion of Divine Truths, the more ſtrongly they Impregnate their Minds, and excite them to purſue the Tendencies of them. And therefore we need not much wonder at thoſe, who are bred up in a Religion contrary to the Truth, as it is in Jeſus, and to his Commandments of Love, Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Who are taught from their Cradles to call us Hereticks, and to ſpeak the bittereſt things againſt us, to Break their Faith with us, and to mark us out for Deſtruction, if in proceſs of time they grow expert in all the Arts of Confuſion, and with undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Undertake the Boldeſt Crimes, which their Party and Principles do Countenance the Practice of.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, the Prejudices of Education are not invincible, if Men would take a right courſe to overcome them: But this is a rare caſe, and there are but few, in Compariſon of thoſe that chooſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their Errors, that are willing to make a Tryal of it. And indeed, when our green and tender Minds are once warpt by falſe and Pernicious Principles, it is no eaſy matter to bring them ſtreight, and to put them into a right Poſture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60756:32"/>It requires a great deal of Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Impartial inquiry into the Reaſon and bottom of things, which ſome Men want abilities of mind, others Leiſure, Humility, Patience, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to carry them through: And the want of any of theſe is enough to anſwer for their obſtinate perſiſting in their Firſt Errours, and unreaſonable Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Affected Ignorance of the Truth, naturally hardens Men in their Evil Principles, and diſpoſes them to approve of any Rugged and violent Courſe to keep up the Reputation of them. The <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviour's time had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Advantages that ever Men enjoyed of being delivered from the Chains and Fetters of an ill Education,<note place="margin">I Pet. 1.18.</note> or (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it) <hi>From their vain Converſation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Tradition from their Fathers.</hi> They had the Brighteſt Revelations of the Divine Nature and Will that ever came from Heaven: And thoſe deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by their own <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom they had long expected: In whom all the Promiſes concerning that Infinite Bleſſing to Mankind were exactly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Who wrought the greateſt and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60756:32"/>moſt Aſtoniſhing Miracles that ever the World beheld: Who gave them a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Comment on the Law, which had been miſerably Corrupted by the Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their Scribes and Doctors, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed open their Hypocriſies to themſelves and all the People; and yet ſo Blind and Sottiſh were they, as to reject all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions with Spight and Scorn, to <hi>Love Darkneſs rather than Light,</hi> to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire their Deluders, and to Crucify their Guide to Eternal Bliſs and Happineſs. Our Saviour himſelf Teſtifies of them in the height of their Rage and Malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him,<note place="margin">Luke 23.34.</note> 
                  <hi>that they knew not what they did.</hi> They had been Taught their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be a Glorious King and Conquerour, and ſuch an One they muſt have or none. They had been long won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Pompous and Ceremonious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: And therefore could not bear the thoughts of having the Stately <hi>Fabrick</hi> of their Religion, Erected by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſupported by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, taken down by the <hi>Carpenters</hi> Son, as they ſtiled our Lord. Theſe were the Fatal Chains that held them faſt in that Dungeon of Darkneſs and Ignorance, which Paradiſe it ſelf could not Tempt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60756:33"/>them, nor the Son of God could not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deem them from.</p>
               <p>And is not the ſame wilfull and Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ignorance ſtill to be found amongſt the Adverſaries of our Religion? Some think there ought to be an Infallible and Univerſal Head of the Church on Earth, and ſuch an one they will have what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it coſts them. Others that are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded of Chriſts Perſonal Reign upon Earth, think they ought to Fight for King Jeſus againſt all Oppoſers. And why is Ignorance ſo much Cheriſht and Applauded in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that it gives the Guides of that Church a mighty advantage to Mis-lead the People, and Embolden them to act any illthing they are pleaſed to Impoſe upon them? And this is the very uſe they make of it; they Teach them to call E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Good, and Good Evil: to Invert the Nature of things, and to Fix the Croſſeſt Names they can deviſe upon them, and then Proſecute them directly contrary to their intrinſick merit: Juſt as the Heathens Cloth'd the Chriſtians in Beaſts Skins, and then expoſed them to be Worried by Wild Beaſts to Death They firſt teach them to call our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60756:33"/>on Hereſie, which naturally creates an Implacable Hatred of it: And having gone thus far, they eaſily perſwade them they cannot be too Zealous to ſuppreſs it; the next ſtep to which Perſuaſion is to think any thing to be lawful that will do it, or if that will not do, it ſhall be Meritorious: And then to deſtroy Hereticks, follows of courſe to be a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Work; But ſurely St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not think ſo, when he confeſt the contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it to the Name of Jeſus. Nor did our Saviour think ſo, when he reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Raſh and Deſtructive zeal of his Diſciples, who would have conſumed the <hi>Samaritans</hi> by Fire from Heaven, telling them, <hi>that they knew not what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Spirits they were of.</hi> And after this,<note place="margin">Luke 9.55.</note> ſhould I preſume to ſay, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have been managed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ſtrength and demonſtration of the Truth on our ſide: Or ſhould I ſay, that no cauſe ſince the ſealing of the Scriptures (unleſs that of our common Chriſtianity) was ever better Defended than our departure from that Church, I ſhould not be aſhamed of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of boaſting.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:60756:34"/>
               <p n="3">3. Secular Intereſts have great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſtort the Judgments of men, and to inflame their Paſſions againſt thoſe that differ from them in matters of Religion. What ever it is they place their chief ſatisfaction in, whether they are bound for the Port of Gain, or Honour or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, we commonly find they make all the Sail that ever they can to come ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to it. If the way to attain their ends be to appear ſtoutly for this, or that Party or Perſuaſion, they will readily do it, and ſerve the cauſe to the Utmoſt, if they happen to thrive by it. Men of corrupt Minds and deſtitute of the Truth, do not uſe to be Baſhful in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Principles when they find their Intereſts in them:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.5.</note> But fuppoſing Gain to be Godlineſs (as the Apoſtle obſerves of them) are generally very forward to ſhew their good Affection to it, and like <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to put the World into an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, out of zeal to the Magnificence of their Great <hi>Diana,</hi> and their Profits from her Shrines and Altars. Conſcience 'tis true, at the firſt, has the leaſt ſhare in the Actions of theſe Men, whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts chooſe chooſe their Principle for them: But what they ſtrongly Affect, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60756:34"/>ſhould be true, in time they ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe; and having willfully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Truth, are given up by the Juſt Judgment of God to their own Deluſions, to Believe and defend the Lye.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some Principles are ſo bad in themſelves, as to inſpire men with a furious and Unchriſtian Zeal, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Worldly Intereſt to inſtigate and puſh them on to violent and Unnatural Actions. Such are theſe which Warrant the Killing of men for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpels, and promiſe them Heaven for the Vileſt Pnactices in the World: For Aſſaſſinating their Natural Prince, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying their Country, and putting it under a Foreign and inſupportable Yoke. Such are all thoſe that make Unlawful and indifferent things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Neceſſary to Salvation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eourage Men to think the better of themſelves for their Zeal againſt ſuch as pretend to nothing but the plain Rules of Chriſtianity, and a Decent Way of ſerving of God in Spirit and in Truth. Theſe Principles do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produce an Envious and Ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60756:35"/>Zeal: 'Tis the property of thoſe that are under the POwer and Guidance of them, to allow no Man a Name for Religion but themſelves, to be angry with every one that do's not Eſpouſe their Follies, to Glory in their Marks of Diſtinction, and take themſelves to be the Holier and better men for differing from all Chriſtians upon Earth.</p>
               <p>And this is too often the effect of that odd and Peeviſh Principle, that Innocent and indifferent things ceaſe to be Lawful when they are once Commanded. No Man knows the malignity of ſuch an Errour as this, ſhould it once get the Aſcendant (which is the Aim and Tendency of it) over that Authority which God hath placed in the Rulers of his Church. Do we not already find the Inſluence of it upon ſome of the ſtrainteſt Sect of our Religion, who yet have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved themſelves a ſufficient Latitude in Scorning and Deriding their Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and are extreamly laviſh in their Cenſures of Perſons of the higheſt Chaeacter and Reverence in the Church of God? Nay, many there are that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60756:35"/>prize and commend themſelves upon theſe very Accounts, and look upon it as a mark of Sanctity, to Break and blemiſh the Communion of that Church, which they pretend no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quarrel with, than only for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing her Authority in ſome indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, <hi>i.e.</hi> making uſe of the Power which Chriſt himſelf hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to every Church, for the benefit and Edification of it. And what is this but to Conſecrate a Schiſm into a ſtate of Perfection, and to do that for Religions ſake, which directly tends to the undoing and ſubverſion of it?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> or a falſe pretence to Divine Inſpiration, is a Fatal cauſe of this Extravagant Zeal. When men have the Conſidence to aſcribe their Errors to the immediate Dictates of the Spirit: When they take themſelves to be the peculiar Favourites of God, in whoſe Breaſts he hath lodg'd his choiceſt Secrets, whom he hath choſen and authorized to bring his moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſigns to paſs, 'tis not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould long content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Pleaſure of theſe Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60756:36"/>ſrons. That Evil Spirit, that hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Eyes, and taught them to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the Holy Ghoſt, had a farther De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon them: And as the Philiftines dealt with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when they had put out his Eyes. will ſurely Employ them in his Drudgeries, and put them upon the moſt deſtructive Attempts. 'Tis hardly to be imagined what deſperate Projects men will freely contribute their Service to, when they are once poſſeſt with a Spirit of Deluſion, and ſtruck Blind with an Opinion, that whatever they ſtrongly Fancy is Infallibly ſo: That 'tis impoſſible for them to Err, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Private Inſtructions from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hitherto hid from Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to Advance the Kingdom of Chriſt, and exalt it to a more glorious Height. To which purpoſe an Eminent Divine of this Church, who had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Sagacity in Tracing and detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Errours of his time)hath left us this memorable paſſage:<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr. Hook</hi> Pref. to Eccl. Pol.</note> 
                  <hi>When Men are once Erroneouſly perſuaded, that 'tis the Will of God to have thoſe things done which they Fancy, then Opinions are as Thorns in their ſides, never ſuffering them to take reſt till they have brought their Skpeculations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60756:36"/>Practice: The Impediments of which Practice their reſtleſs deſire and ſtudy to remove, leadeth them every Day into more dangerour Opinions, ſometimes quite and clean contrary to their firſt pretended mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: So that what will grow out of ſuch Errours, as go mask'd under the Cloak of Divine Authority, impoffible it is that ever the Wit of Man ſhould imagine, till time has brought forth the Fruits of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Proceed now, in the third and laſt place,</p>
               <p n="3">3. To make ſome Inferences brieefly from this Diſcourſe: From whence it will follow,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we have no Reaſon, when we ſee the Effects of this Diſtructive and Unchriſtian Zeal, to be ſtagger'd in our Religion, or to ſuſpect our Faith. That the beſt Religion ſhould meet with the ſharpeſt Oppoſition from Men, that the worſt ſctions ſhould pretend to ſerve it, and receive Authority and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it, that Men of Learning and Knowledge, and of High and Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Zeal ſhould Combine againſt it, are no new things in the World. The Church from her Infancy had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, and our Saviour and his Apoſtles have expreſly foretold them,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60756:37"/>on purpoſe that we ſhould not be Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended when we ſee and feel them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we learn, that an Erroneous Conſcience is a very unſafe and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Guide. And it muſt needs be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſuppoſed to Dictate the mind of God, and by his Authority to guide our Practice. And accordingly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Troubles and Perſecutions which have befallen the Church, are manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Owing to the Deluſions which have paſt under the Name of Conſcience in ſeveral Ages; which ſhould mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken us to look well to our Principles, and to keep our Minds Pure and untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Errour. <hi>If the Light</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that is in thee he Darkneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6.23.</note> 
                  <hi>how great is that Darkneſs?</hi> A little ſpeck in the Eye, fed by an Invincible Humour, often Deftroys the moſt Uſeful and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Senſe: 'Tis ſad to obſerve from what ſmall beginnings the greateſt Errours both in Judgment and Practice have in a ſhort time ſpred and diffuſed themſelves to the infinite Prejudice of Chriſtianity, and the unſpeakable Trouble and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church. To give you one Remarkable Inſtance of this: In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60756:37"/>They, who firſt ſcrupled only the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Infant Baptiſm, by degrees ſo Intangled themſelves in New and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Errours, that in a few Years they grew the higheſt <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> vented the Rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Blaſphemies, and the moſt Fulſome Opinions: And after the faireſt ſhew of ſanctity and ſelf-denial, threw off all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, Indulging themſelves in the moſt Beaſtial and Impudent vices; <hi>in fine,</hi> They Renounc't all Allegiance to their Lawful Superiours ſet up a Pupper King of their own, Dignified him with the Title of Univerſal <hi>Monarch,</hi> and to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Tragedy, Baptiz'd one another with their own Blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the greateſt Zeal is no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the goodneſs of any Cauſe or Principles. While ſome contend as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly againſt, as others do for the Truth, their Zeal can Determine nothing on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. 'Tis the goodneſs of Principles, and the Merit of a Cauſe, that can only Juſtify our Zeal for them: If they be wanting, Zeal is no better than Rage and Frenzy. Therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>It is Good to be Zealouſly affected always in a good thing;</hi> which Implies, that when our Zeal is not thus Qualified, it is good
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60756:38"/>for nothing: Or if it riſes above the Goodneſs of its Object, it ſo far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoots it ſelf, and Degenerates into Vice and Folly. And this is the Fault of thoſe that lay the Weight of Religion upon ſlender things; that can find nothing to ſpend their Zeal upon, but an Innocent Phraſe or Ceremony, that Diſpiſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a Church that does not hit their Phancy in every Punctilio, and ſeem (almoſt) contented the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion ſhould fink rather than the beſt ſupport of it ſhould ſtand, I mean, the Union of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in our Eſtabliſh't National Religion. Theſe are Humours that Charity it ſelf can hardly Excuſe in them, or look upon as any other than the exceſſes of a miſtaken and Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Zeal. In ſhort, Zeal is either the beſt Friend, or the keeneſt Enemy to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for which reaſon we ought to look narrowly to the Grounds and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſee what reaſon we have to be aware of thoſe Perſons, who Teach and Promote ſuch Principles as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the True Spirit and Intereſt of Chriſtianity. I know not what can be ſaid worſe of any Religion, than that it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60756:38"/>inſpires Men with Rage and Cruelty, Quenches the Spirit of Love and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſs, and Repreſents God as the Author of Confuſion, a Humourous and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Being, that is never Pleaſed long with his own Preſcriptions, and therefore muſt be ſooth'd and flatter'd with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is New and Fanciful, that looks like an Exceſs or Tranſport of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, that is Owing to the Good-Will, or III-Nature of Men; ſuch Religion as this can never reconcile it ſelf to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, but will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting it where-ever it comes: And the Zeal it infuſes into Men, will (if not effectually reſtrained) Act over all thoſe Diſmal Tragedies again, of which the Chriſtian Church has been almoſt the Conſtant Scene ever ſince the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. We ſhould therefore be jealous of it in all ſhapes: Whether it Pleads for Unity, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do's, who takes her ſelf to be the Only Church, and therefore Reprobates all that will not be United to her: Or whether it declares for Free-Grace, <hi>i.e.</hi> a Goſpel without a Sanction, as the <hi>German An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> and <hi>Ranters</hi> did, who turn'd the Grace of God into Laſciviouſneſs,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60756:39"/>and liv'd as if it taught them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves no Ungodlineſs or World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luſts; whether it pretends to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Revelations of the Lord, contrary to the Doctrines Received and delivered by his Apoſtles from him: Or whether it ſets up for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Worſhip, in miſtaken or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtances, againſt the Peace of the Church, and contrary to the Wiſdom that is from above, which is <hi>firſt Pure, then Peaceable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Gentle, and Eaſy to be intreated:</hi> Not Peeviſh or implacable, not apt to Quarrel with Shadows, and much leſs to put three Kingdoms into a Flame for the ſake of three harmleſs Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Since Chriſtianity is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to, and has endured ſo much Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from Men, we ſhould learn to adore Gods Infinite Widſom and Goodneſs in Preſerving his Truth, and Protecting his Church, againſt the Zealous Endeavours of their Enemies to ſtifle and deſtroy them. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly We of this Nation have ſeen as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Evidences of this kind, as ever any Chriſtian Nation did. Our deliverances have had ſo many viſible
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60756:39"/>marks of a Divine and Peculiar Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon them, that one would think they ſhould at once clear the Nation of all Atheiſtical Dotage. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Eyes of its Divided Inhabitants, and Diſcourage its moſt zealous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries from Daring any longer that All-ſeeing Eye that hath ſo often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, from ſtrugling any more with that Omnipotent hand, that hath ſo ſeaſonably baffled their Cloſet and moſt perfidious Deſigns and Practices. And doubtleſs were we as ſenſible as we ought to be, of God's ſingular good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us, in caſting us into the Boſom of a Church, where we have all advantages for Eternal Salvation, and in lengthening out our Peace and Tranquility in deſpight of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we ſhould think it out Intereſt to leave our ſelves ſtill in his hands. I do not mean, by ſitting ſtill and neglecting our Guards, but by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in Well-doing, by attempting nothing that is Unworthy of our excellent Religion: By a clear and genuine Zeal for the Honour of God our Saviour; by our Unfeigned thankfulneſs to him for his Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60756:40"/>Mercies, by confiding in his Goodneſs and Protection; by the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of our Prayers, and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with him, and by mutual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes of kindneſs and condeſcention to one another, in any thing that may truly promote our Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: In a word, by adhering to the Old Principles of Chriſtianity, and avoiding the two dangerous Rocks of Superſtition and <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and what ever elſe is contrary to the Name of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grant, O Lord, we beſeech thee, that the courſe of this World may be ſo Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Ordered by thy Governance, that thy Church may Joyfully ſerve thee in all Godly quietneſs, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>

                  <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> were Cities of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſituate on the Sea-Shore, not very far from the Coaſts
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60756:41"/>of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi> They profeſt the Jewiſh Religion, and had the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of hearing our Saviours Doctrine, and beholding his Miracles. But theſe Advantages they were ſo little the better for, that He upbraided them for their Unparallel'd Infidelity and hardneſs of Heart, repreſenting them as more obſtinate than the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens about them: More averſe to their own Hppineſs than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> who had nothing but the weak Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to guide them to it. Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had no Prophets or Scriptures to Inſtruct them, no Miracles to open their Eyes, no promiſes of Pardon or Eternal Life to encourage their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: And yet our Saviour tells us, they were in a better diſpoſition to receive the Goſpel, and would much ſooner have repented at the ſight of his mighty Works, than the <hi>Galileant</hi> that had all the proper means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Encline them to it. And this was the great aggravation of the ſin of theſe impenitent <hi>Jews,</hi> and the ground of the Threatning here De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't
<pb facs="tcp:60756:41"/>againſt them: <hi>Wo unto thee</hi> Chorazin, <hi>Wo unto thee</hi> Bethſaida, <hi>for if the mighty Works which were done in you, had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>they had Repented,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Tho' there ſeems to be no great Difficulty in the meaning of theſe Words, yet (what ever be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it) there is a great Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Interpreters about it: <hi>viz,</hi> Whether our Saviour means, that the effect of his Miracles upon <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> would have been the Real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of thoſe Cities; or whether by their Repenting in <hi>Sackcloth</hi> and <hi>Aſhes,</hi> we are to underſtand no more than a meer External or <hi>Counterfeit Repentance.</hi> That the former of theſe is in ſeveral <hi>reſpects</hi> the more Natural Senſe, as will ſufficiently appear, if we Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scope and Tenour of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Diſcourſe in this place. In the Verſe before the Text the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi> tells us, that he then began to Upbraid the <hi>Cities</hi> where moſt of his
<pb facs="tcp:60756:42"/>mighty Works were done, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Becauſe they Repented not,</hi> i. e. Truly and Heartily: As is clear by the Current Uſage of the Original Word in Scripture, and the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Genuine Importance of it. Beſides, this was the only Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which Chriſt came to Convince the World of the abſolute neceſſity of, and this his Doctrine and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were apt to produce in all that rightly weighed and obſerved them, and therefore if Chriſt Reproved the <hi>Jews</hi> for want of any Repentance, it muſt be for want of this. And from hence it follows, that when He Upbraids them with the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> in <hi>Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth</hi> and <hi>Aſhes;</hi> his meaning muſt be, that theirs would have proved a True, Solemn, and Unfeigned Repentance. For, where is otherwiſe the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding, which the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſpeaks of? If the <hi>Tyrians</hi> had continued Impenitent under the Preaching of the Goſpel, and in View of the mighty Works of our Saviour, they would have done juſt as the <hi>Jews</hi> did; and
<pb facs="tcp:60756:42"/>if they had made a ſhew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, when they did not: Put <hi>Sackcloth</hi> upon their <hi>Loins,</hi> and <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> upon their <hi>Heads,</hi> when their Hearts were as hard, and their Luſts were as Rampant as ever, we may be ſure Chriſt would never have call'd this Repentance, which is all over <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> Nor could this be any Reproach to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to hear that other Nations, had they been in their Circumſtances, would have proved as Wicked or worſe than they. No man thinks it any ſhame to him to be told, that others are every whit as Bad and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as Himſelf: This is not to Aggravate and Upbraid, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtroak and Extenuate his Crimes, by ſhewing the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, and the great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Humane Nature to fall into them. Briefly, our Saviour's ſaying to the Men of <hi>Galilee, That it would be more Tolerable for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon <hi>in the Day of Judgment than for them,</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Refers to the good diſpoſition
<pb facs="tcp:60756:43"/>of thoſe Cities to Repent of their Lewdneſs and Idolatry, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpel. To which may be added.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Converſion of theſe very Nations began ſuddenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of our Saviour, as appears by the Viſits, St. <hi>Paul</hi> made to the Diſciples of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 21.3, 4, 5.27.3</note> Shall we queſtion now, whether theſe were true Penitents and Diſciples or not? If not, why ſhould we think that Chriſt's own Preaching and Miracles might not have wrought the ſame Bleſſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon them, which his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did? Or what Reaſon have we to doubt the Truth of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at any time, when the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel had been tender'd with the ſame advantage to them? Eſpecially, ſince Chriſt himſelf tells us, that they would have Repented long ago in <hi>Sackcloth</hi> and <hi>Aſhes:</hi> Than which it is not eaſy to find a more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Expreſſion, to ſignifie at once a very Solemn and Serious Repentance.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Firſt, That God affords better Means of Grace and Salvation to ſome Perſons and Nations than to others, is clear to all that underſtand any thing of the ſtate of Religion in the World. When God began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh his own People from the reſt of Mankind, he gave them better Means to improve and ſecure his Favour than the reſt enjoyed. He did not leave them mearly to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Natural Light, as he left the greateſt part of Mankind, but reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to them by the miniſtry of Angels and Prophets, by Viſions and Voices from Heaven. He wrote down the Great Rules of their Obedience to him with his own Hand, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them to the practice of them by ſpecial and ample Promiſes. When God choſe the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> at firſt for his Peculiar People, he made an Expreſs Covenant with him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh his Seed by Spiritual Bleſſings from all the Kindreds of the Earth.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60756:44"/>While all the World about him lived in Ignorance and Idolatry, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Gods which their own Fears and Phancies had made, <hi>Abraham</hi> had the Priviledge to Converſe with God, and to behold <hi>the day of</hi> Chriſt <hi>afar off.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</note> He was taught the way of the Lord, and taught his Children to walk in the ſame Paths, to <hi>do Juſtice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that God <hi>might bring upon</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>the great things</hi> which he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him.

The Jews, in compariſon of other Nations, were the very Darlings of Providence; they lived in a Land of Light, when Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs covered the Face of the whole Earth: A Land whoſe leaſt happineſs was, that it flowed with all kinds of Temporal Bleſſings, there being no Nation (as <hi>Moſes</hi> told them,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And as the Jews, of all Nations in the World, ſtood the faireſt for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. So thoſe of them that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in our Saviours time, had Fairer Opportunities of being Happy, than all that lived before them in expectation of his Coming; And of all the Jews of that Age, the Inhabitants of the Great Cities of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Corazin, Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> living in the ſame Country and Neighbourhood that our Saviour did, had the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60756:45"/>for the knowledge of the True God, and the way to Eternal Bliſs and Happineſs. They did not only hear the Fame of his Miracles, and the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho of his Doctrine from diſtant Places, but they Saw and Heard them in the moſt Affecting and Immediate Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; they beheld the Son of God cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with their own Nature, they heard him Preaching in their Streets, many of them that never ſaw or heard any thing in their lives before him. They heard his Divine Sayings, even the Words of Eternal Life from him; they Feaſted on his Miracles, were Fed, Healed and Inlightned by them, and felt the Power of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity in their Reſcue from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Evil Spirits. Thus Salvation came home to the Jews, threw it ſelf as it were into their Arms, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waiting for their Entreaties, urged and obtruded it ſelf upon them.<note place="margin">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60756:46"/>Inſtructions they received from them So that the Jews of our Saviours time, and eſpecially thoſe of his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and Acquaintance, had the Beſt Means of Salvation of any People up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth: And this was plainly the meaning of that Saying of his to the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> [John 4.22.] that <hi>Salvation is of the Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, after the Aſcenſion of our Lord, and the Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the Gentile World, all thoſe Nations to which the Goſpel came, ſtood upon the ſame Level with the Jews; I mean, had as Great Reaſon to believe the Goſpel, and embrace the tenders of it, as the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had, thoſe only excepted that ſaw our Saviour when he was riſen from the Dead. But ſome Nations have never yet received the Goſpel; and Myriads there are of People in the World, that never ſo much as heard of the Name of Jeſus, or the Holy Bible. Others, that once em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Goſpel, and made a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Figure in the Chriſtian Church, have by departing from the Faith, and corrupting themſelves with Lewd Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60756:46"/>and Practices, loſt all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Priviledges that were conferred upon them. Of this number were the ſeven Famous Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> from whom Chriſt has recalled his Angels, and fetchr away his Golden Candleſticks, and left them in a Dark Night of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Superſtition. And this ſhews that the Beſt Means of Grace and Salvation are not entailed upon particular Nations: And that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan may ſtand upon the Ruines of thoſe which were once the moſt Orthodox and Flouriſhing Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if we take a view of the ſtate of Religion in the Chriſtian World at this day, nothing is more evident than the Vaſt Difference there is in the Adminiſtration of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments (which are the Principal Means of Grace) in ſeveral Churches of the Greateſt Name, and the Higheſt Pretence to Purity of Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And that there is One above all the Reſt, where the Scriptures, the Great Inſtrument of our Salvation, are wreſted out of the Hands of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60756:47"/>leſt they ſhould diſcern the wrong that is done them in denying them the <hi>Key of Knowledge,</hi> and with their own Eyes ſee the things which belong to their Eternal Peace.</p>
               <p>Now by all theſe Inſtances it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that there is a great Inequality in the Diſpoſal of the Means of Grace, and that God does not afford them to all Men, or in all Ages, alike: But to ſome he gives more, and to others leſs, according to his Sovereign Will and Pleaſure.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.14, 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> And this our Saviour hath very plainly repreſented to us in the Parable of the Talents, which the Lord that was Travelling into a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try diſtributed to his Servants: To one he gave five, to another two, and to a third but a ſingle Talent, with this General Charge, that what they had received they ſhould employ to his advantage, till his occaſions ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his return to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall now endeavour to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Providence of God in reference to this Particular Diſpenſation of it, by ſhewing that there is no Injuſtice in the Unequal Diſtribution of the Means of Grace and Happineſs. To
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60756:47"/>clear this, we muſt conſider what a Reaſonable Creature, that is framed to deſire its own Happineſs, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from a Juſt and Faithful Creator. And ſurely he may expect, that the Author of his Being, and of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of being Happy, Hould once at leaſt put it into his Power to be ſo: And that he ſhould not call him to an Account for not Improving any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for it, which he never enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe two things, I ſay, he may promiſe himſelf, becauſe a Being Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Good and Juſt, as God is, could not make him, only to make him Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, as he muſt have done, ſhould he either deny him all Power to be Happy, or puniſh him Eternally for not improving the Power which he never gave him.</p>
               <p>But then there is no Reaſon from the Nature of Juſtice to expect, that God ſhould do more for Man than this; becauſe this is enough to make him Happy, if he be not wanting to himſelf; and if he be, is Juſt he ſhould be Miſerable, ſince he might and would not be Happy. For God, who had made us Free and Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60756:48"/>Creatures, is not bound to force us into Happineſs againſt our choice, no more than he was bound to Create us at firſt in a ſtate of Perfect and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Happineſs. Nor does his Juſtice require of him, that he ſhould be Equally Gracious to all Men, and put them into the ſame advantagious Circumſtances for the attainment of Eternal Life. His giving better Means to one Perſon than to another, is no wrong to him that has enough to bring him to the ſame Bleſſed State. All that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Faithful Creator is, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given us Being capable of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs and Miſery, he ſhould not deny us that Meaſure of Grace, without which, tho we ſhould do our utmoſt to pleaſe him, we muſt be Miſerable. And therefore all that is requiſite to juſtifie the Providence of God in this matter, is to prove that he gives every man ſufficient Power to be Happy, and will take an account of him for no more than he really gives him. For the firſt of theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God affords every man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Power to be happy. I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to weigh the Argument al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60756:48"/>ſuggeſted for it. It is certain, that God has planted an Eternal Deſire of Happineſs in the Heart of Man, and that this Deſire is the great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Virtue and Obedience to the Will of God; and this, I think, is a good Argument to prove, that God does not fruſtrate this Deſire by his meer Will and Pleaſure, I mean, by denying any man that Grace and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which is abſolutely neceſſary to his attainment of it; becauſe the conſequence of this would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and undeſerved Unhappineſs to him, which is never to be reconciled to the Rules of Juſtice and Equity. But beſides this, God allows every man to expect that which is evidently juſt and fair from him, and ſo far makes him Judge in his own caſe, knowing himſelf to be infinitely clear in his Dealings with him. His appealing to the Common Notionsof men concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this equity of his Actions towards them, and giving them warning to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an Univerſal Judgment, are very plain Demonſtrations of this Truth. <hi>Come now, let us Reaſon together,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaith the Lord; What Iniquity have your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60756:49"/>found in me?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Is not my way Equal, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Whence I argue thus: We ought not to faſten any thing upon God which evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Natural Notions of Juſtice and Equity; and therefore ought not to charge him with creating men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of being Eternally Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for want of ſufficient Power to be Happy, becauſe this is a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Natural and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Notions of Juſtice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. What is this, but to thruſt men into the World, only to gain an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to inflict Eternal Torments upon them in the next? And if this be fair and juſt Dealing, I deſire to know what is that we may have heave to call Gruel and Unjuſt. The greateſt Evil we can poſſibly have any Idea of, is that of Eternal Damnation: And the Higheſt Injuſtice is to inflict the Greateſt Evil upon meer Pleaſure, or, which reſolves into it, for not doing ſomething that was ever Impoſſible to be done: And then to charge God with Damning Men at Pleaſure, or for what they never had Power to help, is to charge the Father of Mercies with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60756:49"/>Tranſcendent Cruelty, and the Judge of the whole World with the Higheſt Injuſtice. And I cannot imagine why men that are lovers of Truth, and have a tender ſence of Gods Honour, ſhould not be willing to let fall ſuch a Charge as this, rather than own God to be ſo Good and Juſt, as to allow every man ſufficient Grace to do Well and be Happy; which is a Thought that ſits eaſie upon the Mind, being every way ſquare and ſutable to its Natural Notions of the Divine Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Whereas the contrary, after all endeavours to reconcile it to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, is a <hi>Bold</hi> and <hi>Staring</hi> Contradiction to it.</p>
               <p>After this, what need I ſay, That tis natural to ſuppoſe that God hath a Paternal Affection to all his Off-ſpring: That he has given every man a Law, in his own Breaſt, to guide him to Virtue and Happineſs: That he ſhews to every man what is Good, and does not expect Impoſſibilities from any: That he gives Common Grace to All, and tis certain he gives nothing in vain: Whereas all his Grace and Favour to Heathens and Wicked Chriſtians
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60756:50"/>would be utterly in vain, if it were not an earneſt of Special and Saving Grace, ſuppoſing them to make the beſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of it, which are poſſible for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God will take an account of men only for ſuch Means of Grace as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gives them. In the ay of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no man ſhall anſwer for two Talents, that received but one. The Heathens that have but the ſingle Light of Nature to guide them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and Heaven, ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for not believing in Chriſt, when they never heard of him. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, Rom. 2.11, 12. <hi>There is no Reſpect of Perſons with God: For as many as have ſinned without the Law, ſhall periſh without the Law; and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law, i.e.</hi> God will judge the World by a Juſt and Equitable Rule, according to the Means that men have enjoyed, and the Opportunities they have had of knowing and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Will, and not by any Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſpects, which too often warp and pervert the Judgments of Men. And then the poor Heathen, that never
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60756:50"/>had any written Divine Law to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Actions,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16.</note> but was led by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to <hi>do the things contained in the Law,</hi> ſhall be tried by the Laws which Nature taught him: The Jew by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Inſtructions of the Prophets: And the Chriſtian, that has far better Means of Salvation than both theſe, ſhall be judged by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or Law of Chriſt. And from hence it follows, that God will reckon with man at the laſt day only for their own meaſure of Grace, be it more or leſs; every man ſhall be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him for ſo much as he receives from him, and no more will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at his Hands; and ſo doing, it is evident, that he cannot be injurious to any. For God is not obliged to give equal meaſures of Grace to all men, and to exceed what is neceſſary to bring them to Happineſs. He did not owe the World a Redeemer, or ſo much as a ſingle Prophet or Meſſenger from Heaven. The whole Covenant of our Redemption was an Act of Pure Sovereign Grace, and not the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of a Debt, the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment of which had been the breach
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60756:51"/>of any Rule of Juſtice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In giving men the neceſſary Means of obtaining his Favour in this and the Life to come, God diſcharges the part of a Juſt and Faithful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as he will do that of a Righteous Judge, by calling every man to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count only for the Talents he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with; all that is more than this, is meer Grace and Bounty, to which we have no Plea of Right or Equity, and therefore have no wrong done us, if it pleaſes God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it from us.</p>
               <p>And this, I preſume, is enough to clear the Juſtice of Providence, as to the various Diſpenſations of the Means of Grace and Happineſs. To which I ſhall only add, that if we rightly conſider things, the caſe of Ignorant Heathens may not perhaps appear ſo very hard and deplorable above other mens, as we are apt to make it. For certainly the Diſobedient Jews will have a greater Account to give than they, as having ſinned againſt Greater Light: And a bad Chriſtian will have a much heavier Charge againſt him than either of them. And tho it be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60756:51"/>true, that <hi>there is no other Name under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whereby men can be ſaved, but only the Name of Chriſt,</hi> yet it does not follow that the Heathens ſhall be never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Chriſt, becauſe they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Dying for Sinners: For this the Apoſtles themſelves ſeemed not to know till after his Reſurrection, and then it is not to be thought that all the pious Jews that lived before them ſhould know it, who yet (we doubt not) were all ſaved by the merit of his Death. However, it does not become us to judge the whole Heathen World, till God himſelf has done it; and the rather, becauſe we are aſſured that he has <hi>Ordained</hi> the ſame Perſon <hi>to be Judge</hi> both of Us and them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16.</note> and that he will judge <hi>according to the Goſpel, i.e.</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to the Mild and Gracious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of it. And ſince the Heathens were included in the firſt Promiſe of a Saviour, made to all Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> [<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.] who knowsm, but thoſe of them that worſhipped the One true God, according to the Light which he gave them, may be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo in the Common Salvation?</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:60756:52"/>
               <p>I proceed now to the Second Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which is this,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2d. Obſer.</hi> That the ſame Means of Grace which are unprofitable to ſome Perſons, would ſurely have been effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to the Reformation of others; if they had enjoyed them. Of this we have a plain Inſtance in the Text; <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> who have the character, both in Scripture, and Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, of a very Diſſolute People, if they had enjoyed the Preaching, and been ſo happy as to have ſeen the Mighty Works of our Saviour, would aſſuredly have yielded to the Natural Impreſſions of them, and embraced the Goſpel-condition of Repentance, which the Jews rejected and ſpurned at. And the ſame Obſervation God himſelf makes concerning the Temper of his own People, and other Nations in former Ages, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. where we find, when God gave a Charge to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and fent him to Propheſie againſt the Houſe of <hi>Iſael;</hi> he tells them before hand, that the ſame Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition would certainly have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome other People, but he muſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60756:52"/>not expect the like ſucceſs amongſt thoſe he was going to; for they were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Impieties, and reſolved to have their way, tho they could ſeo nothing but Deſtruction before them; <hi>Thou art not</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſent unto a People of a ſtrange Speech, and an hard Language, but to the Houſe of</hi> Iſrrel: <hi>Not to many People — whoſe words thou canſt not underſtand: Surely had I ſent thee to them, they would have heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto thee, for they will not hearken unto me: For all the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are Impudent and Hard-hearted.</hi> Now what is plainer in theſe Inſtances, than that God did foreſee that other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would have taken the Warnings, and embraced the Meſſages which he ſent the Jews in divers Manners and Ages by the Prophets, and at laſt by his Son Jeſus Chriſt: And which for the moſt part, they as ſcornfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as they were kindly offered and propounded to them? And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find, when the Apoſtles, after our Saviours Aſcenſion, preacht the Goſpel to the Gentiles, that it Ran and was Glorified amongſt them, while the Jews did their utmoſt to oppoſe it,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60756:53"/>and put all the Diſgrace and Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they could deviſe upon it.</p>
               <p>And the Truth is, this is the very thing that haſtned the Goſpel into the Gentile World. The barrenneſs of the Soil it was planted in, through the wilfull hardneſs and infidelity of the Jews, and the plentiful Harveſt there was like to be in other Countries, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned <hi>the Lord of the Harveſt to ſend the Labourers</hi> abroad, in expectation of better Returns for all his Expence and Kindneſs. 'Twas not ſit they ſhould ſit ſtill, when they might be better employed, and had the Converſion of the whole World upon their Hands. And therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> preacht at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 13.45, 46.</note> and the Jews contradicted and blaſphemed their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, while the Gentiles flockt in great multitudes to hear it, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles (applying themſelves to the Jews) told them, <hi>it was neceſſary that the Word of God ſhould have been firſt ſpoken to you: But ſeeing ye put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, loe we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> And a happy turn it was, for by this Means the Goſpel had a free and ſpeedy
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60756:53"/>paſſage into the World, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it came, turned men <hi>from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto Light, and from: he Power of Satan unto the Living God.</hi> And upon this account St. <hi>Paul</hi> tellls us, <hi>that the Fall of the Jews was the Riches of the World, and the Diminiſhing of them the Riches of the Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 11.12. <hi>i.e.</hi> The Poor Ignorant Heathens, that were hitherto deſtitute of the Beſt Means of Saving Knowledge, were mighty Gainers by the infidelity of the Jews, as ſucceeding immediately to the ſame Rich and Glorious Priviledges, the ſame Powerful means of Grace and Salvation, which the Jews had forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But that which I chiefly aim at, is this:</p>
               <p>The Converſion of the Gentiles by the Preaching of the Goſpel, which the Jews rejected, undeniably proves that the ſame Means of Grace are both Profitable and Ineffectual to ſeveral Perſons and Nations, according as they are diſpoſed to uſe them. But why do I inſiſt on ſo plain a Truth, when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Society of Chriſtians in the World is an ample and viſible Demonſtration of it?</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:60756:54"/>
               <p>Now if the ſame Means of Grace may have ſuch Different Succeſs, as to be rejected by ſome, whilſt others are reformed and converted by them, from hence we may gain theſe two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Grace of God is not wrought in men by Means which they cannot reſiſt. Nothing is plainer, than that our Saviour upbraided the Jews for reſiſting the ſame Kind and Meaſure of Grace, which would have wrought Repentance in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon:</hi> And this we may ſafely ſay, was not Irreſiſtible Grace, for then it could not be the ſame which the Jews reſiſted. Beſides, Chriſts upbraiding the Jews for not Repenting, implies, that it was their own Fault they did not; which yet could not be, unleſs God had firſt put it into them power to Repent: but this, it is plain, he did not, if nothing leſs than Irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Grace could have brought them to Repentance.</p>
               <p>Now this Conſideration, that the Means of Grace are Reſiſtible, ſhould make us extreamly cautious of driving off our Repentance and Amendment of Life, in expectation of ſome mighty
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60756:54"/>irreſiſtible Act of God, to ſave us the labour of turning our ſelves to him. There is no doubt but God can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the moſt ſtubborn and inflexible Wills of Men, and bear them down, in ſpight of all their Reluctancies, into the Faith and Obedience of the Goſpel; And had hepromiſed them ſo to do, they might ſafely have depended upon him. But ſince he has made no ſuch Promiſe, and does every day permit Incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sinners to reſiſt his Holy Spirit, and withſtand the Goſpel, till they have ſinned beyond the poſſibility of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. How ſhould this awaken thoſe that have any purpoſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting at all, to put themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the danger of miſcarrying for ever, by a ready and immediate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them? The laſt care that God will ever take of the Salvation of Men, is long ſince diſcovered to them in the Goſpel: And by an experience of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years it is evident in all Churches, that the Goſpel does not carry an Irreſiſtible Force along with it. It gives men all the Reaſon, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them of all the Help and Aſſiſtance that can be reaſonably deſired, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60756:55"/>them into a compliance with it, and there it leaves them; <hi>i. e.</hi> it leaves them to their choice, to accept or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe its Propoſals, and ſo to be Happy or Miſerable as they pleaſe. So that if men will not take any pains with themſelves to underſtand their Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Intereſt, and to ſtoop their minds to the Obedience of the Goſpel, but wait to ſee what God will do with them, they will find that he will not drive them into Heaven againſt their Wills.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it folows, that the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency of men under the Goſpel, is to be aſcribed to their own wilful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible Temple, and not to any weakneſs or inſufficiency in the Goſpel to reform and ſanctifie them. The Goſpel has ſufficiently verified what it ſpeaks of it ſelf, that it is <hi>the Power of God to Salvation.</hi> The Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it has wrought in the World from all kinds of Superſtition, Wickedneſs and Impiety, abundantly teſtifie the Divine Virtue and Efficacy of it: And (what is all along ſuppoſed in this Diſcourſe) the Good Spirit of God is always ready to bleſs the Means of his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60756:55"/>own Appointment, and to make them effectual to his own Gracious Ends and Purpoſes, without reſpect of Perſons, where men do not diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their wilful neglect or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and peremptory Oppoſition to them. This being the caſe, there can be no other reaſon why the Goſpel at any time fails of its Bleſſed Effect, but the ſtupid and inflexible Temper of thoſe that live unprofitably under the mighty influences of it. And hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> imputes the Impenitency of ſuch men to their <hi>Deſpiſing the Goodneſs and Forbearance of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>and not knwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth to Repentance:</hi> Which ſurely he would not have done, had he known the While, that God was not ſo Good unto them, as to furniſh them with ſufficient Grace to Repent withal.</p>
               <p>Conſidering then what Different Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the miniſtration of the Goſpel has upon the Hearts and Lives of Men, and the reaſon why ſome are hardned, while others are inllightned and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Spirit of their Minds, we ſee there lies a great deal upon our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to diſpoſe and qualifie our
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60756:56"/>Hearts, leſt the Word ſhould not profit us, <hi>which is able to ſave our Souls.</hi> The Beſt Means of Grace, the moſt Powerful Preaching in the World, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the mighty Operations of the Spirit, will not ſoften our Hearts, will not melt them into Repentance, while we ſuffer them to be <hi>heardned by the Deceitfulneſſ of Sin.</hi> And there fore neither our Saviour, nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ever pretended to convert all that heard them, or that ſaw them do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles by the Finger of God There is a certain good Temper and ingenuity of Mind, diſpoſing us to be juſt to our ſelves, and to the Truths we hear, which is requiſite to our Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by them. <hi>Judas</hi> heard as Good Preaching, and certainly got as little Good by it as ever any man did. His eager deſire of Wealth and Worldly Gains (which ſeem to have been his Aim in keeping cloſe to our Saviour, hoping according to the Common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that he would have proved a Great Temporal Monarch) had ſo perverted his Mind, that the Beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and the moſt Abſolute Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Virtue and Piety that ever
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60756:56"/>the World had, could not prevail with him to be Virtuous and Good. We ſhould therefore be very cautious, leſt the ſame Word which is <hi>a Savour of Life</hi> to others, ſhould prove a Sentence of Death and Condemnation to our Selves. But I haſten to the third and laſt Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p n="3">3d. <hi>Obſer.</hi> Than the final condition of thoſe that reject the Goſpel, and continue impenitent under the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it, will be more grievous and intolerable than theirs, that were never called to Repentance by it. So our Saviour told the Cities of <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida; It ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon <hi>in the Day of Judg than for you, i.e.</hi> they that have only reſiſted the Light of Nature, ſhall then receive a milder Sentence than you, that have Guides and Inſtructors from Heaven, that have had the Son of God among you, that have rejected his Doctrine, diſregarded his Miracles, and refuſed the Greateſt Salvation that was ever offered to men.</p>
               <p>Now, that this <hi>Wo</hi> belongs to all that obey not the Goſpel preached to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60756:57"/>them, tho they never heard a ſyllable from Chriſt himſelf, or ſaw the leaſt of thoſe <hi>Mighty Works,</hi> with which he <hi>upbraids</hi> the Galileans in the Text, will appear if we conſider that God has provided as well for the Faith of the Church in this and all future Ages, as he did for that of the Jews, that lived in the days of our Saviour. And if there be as much reaſon now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, as there was in our Saviour's time, 'tis certain there is as much reaſon to fear th Threatnings denounced in it againſt Impenitent Sinners. I know we are apt to fanſie that the Hearers of Chriſt's Doctrine, and the Spectators of his Miracles, ſtood in much better light to diſcern the Divinity of them, than we do at this day. But wherein does the great difference lie? They ſaw Chriſt in the Fleſh;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2, 3.</note> but they <hi>ſaw no Beauty in him that</hi> they <hi>ſhould Doſire him;</hi> yea, they ſaw him in ſo humble a Guiſe and Habit, as raiſed their Contempt more than their Admiration of him. They had but the ſame Propheſies concerning his comeing, and the Quality of his Perſon, which the Chriſtian Church
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60756:57"/>from the firſt Foundation of it has been all along in poſſeſſion of. They heard <hi>the Gracious Words that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from him: But certainly neither <hi>Chorazin</hi> nor <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> nor <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf, heard ſo much of the Doctrine of Chriſt. till after his Reſurrection, as the four Goſpels have acquainted us with. The Jews indeed had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being Eye-witneſſes of his Miracles, which it is impoſſible we ſhould have: But beſides, that we have Invincible Evidence of the Reality of them, from the Teſtimony of Perſons too Good and too Knowing to deceive us, inſerted into the moſt Ancient and Sacred Records of our Religion, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Univerſal Church in all Ages, and confirmed by the declared Enemies of our Saviour and his Do-Doctrine: I ſay, beſides all this, the Goſpel has ſince received as great and extraordinary Confirmations, as it did by all the Miracles that were ſeen in <hi>Galilee;</hi> I mean, by the Reſurrection of our Lord himſelf from the Dead, and by the wonderful effects which the Preaching of the Goſpel has wrought in the World: By its Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60756:58"/>over all the Wiſdom and Learning of the Greeks, and all the Power and Policy of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: By its Thriving under the hotteſt Perſecutions, and Planting it ſelf in the very Hearts of thoſe, that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Force that was employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: In ſhort, by the Gradual Fulfilling of the Propheſies contained in the Goſpel concerning the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Reprobation of the Jewiſh Nation, the Coming of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and the ſtrange Figure and Havock which he ſhould make in the World. Theſe things are come to paſs ſince the Death of our Saviour, and we and our Fathers have ſeen them: And in theſe reſpects we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently as much advantage of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Text, as they had of us in point of Miracles.</p>
               <p>Now ſince we have as great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth of the Goſpel, as the Impenitent Jew had, if we reſiſt it as they did, and perſiſt in Unbelief and Diſobedience to it, what can we expect, but that the <hi>Wo</hi> denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ſhould fall with its full Weight and Terror upon us?
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60756:58"/>p1 1. For firſt, It is evident by the Light of Nature, and it is the Ground of all the Threatnings in the Goſpel, that Puniſhment is due to Sin, and that the more and the greater Sins any man is guilty of, the more Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he deſerves. And who ſhall tell us what Puniſhment we deſerve for our Sins, but he that is our Natural Law-giver, and our Rightful Judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God has expreſly declared, that he will <hi>render to every man acconding to his Deeds,</hi> Rom. 2.6. And then he will certainly puniſh a wicked Chriſtian, not only for ſuch ſins as he is guilty of in common with wicked Jews and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that never received the Goſpel, but alſo for the abuſe of Goſpel-Grace, the violation of his Sacred Vows and Promiſes, and the neglect of all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and Advantages he has had of Improving himſelf in all Chriſtian Virtues and Graces. 'Tis true, that this Declaration of God, that he will Judge us according to our Works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Goſpel, muſt he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a Goſpel ſenſe, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſo as to leave room for Repentance: But then we are to conſider, that this veru A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:60756:59"/>of Grace, if we do not Repent, will only inflame our Account, and make our Condemnation the more Juſt and Terrible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To Reject the Goſpel, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Impenitent under the Diſpenſation of it, is to fruſtuate the Beſt Means of Salvation, the moſt extraordinary Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ever was ſhewn to men; and therefore deſerves the ſevereſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſoreſt Damnation. We can never hope for Better Means of getting to Heaven, than what the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel has furniſht us with, unleſs God had a Dearer Son, and a more Prevailing Mediator, than the Beloved and Holy Jeſus, to beſtow upon us.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60756:59"/>many Stripes.</hi> And thus Hypocrites and Unbelievers are markt out for the moſt diſmal and intolerable Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And nothing can be Juſten, when God hath made the greateſt condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to men, that are conſiſtent with his Juſtice, Wiſdom and Holineſs, than that they, who would not ſtoop to his Mercy, ſhould fall under his High Diſpleaſure, and feel the Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Strokes of his Mighty Indignation. <hi>If the Word ſpoken by Angels was ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,</hi>

                  <hi>and every Tranſgreſſion received a juſt Reward, how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo Great Salvation</hi> as was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>by our Lord, and confirmed unto us by them that heard him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the uſe we ſhould make of this Admonition, is to conſider the Danger we are in, as to the Publick and our own Concerns; and to haſten our eſcape out of it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Let us then reflect upon the Danger we are in by our Great Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, and abuſe of thoſe Excellent Means of Grace we have long enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, through God's tranſcendent Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Patience towards us. Was ver People more highly favoured by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60756:60"/>Divine Providence? Was ever any Church Adorned with more burning and ſhming Lights in one Age, than the Preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> is? We cannot plead that we have wanted the Means of Inſtruction, or any thing elſe that is neceſſary to Salvation; 'Tis plain, we have wanted nothing ſo much as the Hearing Ear, and the good and honeſt Heart: And for want of theſe, many have ſnuft at the Word of Life, and kickt at the Ordinances of God: While others have for many years ſat contentedly under them. This, if we add to it the badneſe of our Principles, and the debauchery of our Lives, is a very ſad and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Conſideration; eſpecially in the caſe we are in, who ſeem to have clean forgot, that the Goſpel came into this Iſland to call us to Repentance.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, that the Judgment of Kingdoms and States is and muſt be in this World, becauſe there will be no ſuch Societies in the next; and we cannot tell how near the Day of our Particular Judgment may be; but ſurely it haſtens as faſt as we do to make up the Meaſure of our Sins, and to declare
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60756:60"/>that we are not to be cured by any Methods of Grace, or any Revelations of the Wrath of God from Heaven. 'Tis no new thing for God to bereave a Sinful Nation at once of the greateſt Comforts of this Life, and of the Means of Grace for a Better. And ſince the Goſpel has already taken leave of ſome Churches, that houriſht in their time as much as we do at this day, how ſhould this awaken us to a General Repentance, and to make our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as ſolemn and conſpicuons to the World, as our days of Faſting and Humiliation have been? I grant, we are ſtill a People, in ſome reſpects, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the World: We Plough the Ocean as well, and reap as much advantage, perhaps, as any of our Neighbours by it. We ſend our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Fleets and Armies abroad, and look Big upon the Nations that are round about us. And we are, or might be, a free People at home (if it were not for Tyrannical Luſts;) and in reſpect of our Spiritual Advantages, are like <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23.</note> lifted up unto Heaven: But let us not value our ſelves too much upon theſe things, but conſider that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60756:61"/>our Fall is never the farther off, and will be but the more dreadful at laſt, if we go on to provoke Heaven by our ſins, and ungrateful Barrenneſs under the kindeſt Influences of it.</p>
               <p>However, there is a certain Day of Judgment to come, when God will call every man in his own Perſon to an account for the Talents he has receiv'd, and the Improvement he ought to have made of them. And ſince our Eternal Condition depends upon the preſent Neglect or Improvement of the Means of Grace,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Let us be perſuaded to avoid the Danger, and prevent the Terror of the laſt Judgment, by bringing forth <hi>Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to our enjoyment and profeſſion of the Goſpel. To ſtrengthen this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, I will leave theſe two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations with you, and conclude.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Goſpel has waited much longer upon you than it did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cities of <hi>Galilee,</hi> when Chriſt upbraided them for the refuſal of it. In the ſpace of three years, which our Saviour ſpent in Preaching the Goſpel, there could not be much time for his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60756:61"/>Preaching in any other Particular Place, conſidering what his manner of Life was, that he went about doing Good, and was almoſt continually moving from one City and Village to another. Now if Chriſt did ſo ſeverely Threaten theſe Cities after ſo ſhort a Trial, what will become of thoſe that ſpend their whole Lives in an obſtinate refuſal of Divine Grace, and after the loudeſt warnings and ſummons to Repent, ſtand out againſt all the force and power of the Goſpel, till they ſee Death and Eternity preſſing upon them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, that our very Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, if we obey it not, will but inflame our Guilt, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our Condemnation. We ſhall be found greater Sinners in the Day of Judgment, than thoſe Galileans that never entertained the Goſpel, if after all our Profeſſions of Faith in Chriſt, and the Sacred Vows and engagements with which we have ſolemnly bound our Souls to obey him; we ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly renounce him by a profane and vicious Converſation, or ſecretly withdraw our Hearts and Affections from him. This would argue ſuch
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60756:62"/>Baſeneſs and Treachery in us, ſuch vile Hypocriſie and Ingratitude, as can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven without a New Goſpel, and a New Sacrifice for Sin, which no man was ever ſo wretchedly vain to hope for. And what remains then, but a fearful expectation of the Day of Judgment, and being then found in a worſe Eſtate than Heathens and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels?<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21</note> 
                  <hi>For it had been better</hi> for us <hi>not to have known the way of Righteouſneſs, than after we have known it, to turn from the Holy Commandments delivered unto us.</hi> Let us therefore be ſo wiſe for our ſelves, as to make uſe of the Laſt and Only Remedy which God has left us; and not burn the Day-light of Grace, which ſtill ſhines ſo Gloriouſly upon us. So Infinite a Mercy ought not to be plaid and trifled with. Our Danger grows every day with our Delays: And a <hi>long refuſal</hi> of the Grace of God, is <hi>next to a final</hi> and <hi>abſolute rejection</hi> of it, and that is the very <hi>next ſtep</hi> to Everlaſting Deſtruction. Briefly, we have all the Warnings that can be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expected from a Being of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doreable Goodneſs and Holineſs, to <hi>break off our Sites by Righteouſneſs,</hi> that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60756:62"/>
                  <hi>Iniquity may not be our Ruine.</hi> He hath ſolemnly declared, that he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in the Death of them that Periſh, but chooſes that they ſhould Return and Live, Repent and be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Let us therefore, now God is waiting to ſee what we will chooſe, and which way we will determine our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condition, Faſten our return to him with all imaginable ſpeed; and not ſignalize our Folly by being the Authors of our own Deſtruction, by hardning our Hearts, and delaying our Repentance, till his abuſed Grace is for ever withdrawn, and there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility left us of eſcaping the Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hell.</p>

               <p>THeſe Words are part of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Parable concerning an Houſhoulder, to whom he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the Kingdom of Heaven in this reſpect, that he went out at ſeveral Hours of the Day to hire Labourers into his Vineyard. With ſome he agreed early in the Morning for a Penny
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60756:63"/>a Day, and immediately ſent them to their Work; others he hired at the Third, the Sixth, the Ninth Hour, and ſome not until the Eleventh, upon a General Promiſe of doing them all Right in their Wages. Now here was a great inequality in the Time which the ſeveral Labourers wrought in the Vineyard; the Firſt beginning early in the Morning, bore all the Heat and Burden of the Day; the Laſt wrought but one Hour in the Cool of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And whereas it was expected that the Lord of the Vineyard would have conſidered this, and made every mans Wages proportionable to the time of his Service, he made no diſtinction at all between them; but the Firſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Agreement, received every man a Penny: And when they came, that were hired about the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Hour, 'tis ſaid, they alſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved every man a Penny.</p>
               <p>Now I need not tell you, that there are thoſe that would infer from hence, that the Sinner that Repents at the laſt hour of his Life, is as ſafe, and may be as ſecure of Heaven, as if he had been all his Life long employed in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60756:64"/>of God, and working out his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling. And what Sinner upon Earth, that ever thinks of Repenting before he dies, can deſire to hear a more delicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine than this? There is nothing can pleaſe a wicked man better, while he retains the ſence of another World, than to have his liberty to enioy his Sins as long as he can, and not fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damned for them when he dies; and therefore any Doctrine that puts him into a way to do this, muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry welcome to him. And indeed of all that have been preſt for this Service, there is none that promiſes fairer, than that which has been raiſed out of this Parable of our Saviour concerning the Labourers, and which aſſures every wicked man that he may Repent time enough to be ſaved, at his laſt hour. For, if he may do ſo, we can never convince him that he may not take his liberty the mean while, or that there is any neceſſity of Repenting in haſte. He may be as wild and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as he pleaſes, gratifie every ſenſual Deſire, and dance through all the Scenes of a Comical and Voluptuous Life,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60756:64"/>provided he take care, when he is glutted with the pleaſure of Sinning, to Repent once for all; and to do no more wickedly, when he has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time nor Temptation to do it. And were this the true and plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, I cannot imagine why one ill man ſhould be an Enemy to it: I rather think, that ſo ſoon as ever he came to underſtand it, he would be perfectly reconciled to the whole Doctrine of Chriſtianity for the ſake of this Kind Fare-well to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it. And I dare appeal to any wicked Chriſtian, what ever he thinks of this Opinion, whether he does not heartily wiſh it were true, and would not gladly ſee it confirmed by plain Scripture and Reaſon. Now certainly this is no great Commendation of any Doctrine, but rather a juſt Prejudice againſt it: It being enough to make a good and wiſe man ſuſpect, that it is not ſound at bottom, becauſe it takes ſo univerſally with bad men.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee what Foundation this Opinion has in Scripture, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this Parable of our Saviour (ſo often cited for it) concerning the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60756:65"/>that went into the Vineyard about the Eleventh Hour, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as good Wages as they that went Early in the Morning, and had borne the Heat of the Day. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I deſire to ſpeak as home, and as plainly to this matter, as the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it requires, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Parable has no relation to the Caſe of a Late or Death-bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is no other ground of aſſurance in the Goſpel, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of a Dying Chriſtian, after a whole Life ſpent in Sin, and an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate violation of his Baptiſmal Vow and Covenant, will ſecure him of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation.</p>
               <p>But before I enter upon this Task, I deſire it may be conſidered, That the Controverſies concerning the ſence of Scripture muſt be endleſs and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, unleſs we agree upon proper and certain Rules to Guide us in the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it: And ſurely we cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily think of better in expounding the Parables of the Goſpel, than firſt to be ſtrictly careful that we do not ſet the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60756:65"/>Goſpel at variance with it ſelf, or make one Parable claſh and interfere with another: And then if there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in explaining them, or it ſo happens that the words are fairly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of two or more different Senſes, the ſureſt way to come to a ſatisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the true meaning of them, is to obſerve the Occaſion our Saviour took to utter them; to follow the Thread of his Diſcourſe upon that Occaſion, and if need be to have recourſe to more plain and lightſome Scriptures, the ſenſe of which is agreed upon by the generality of the moſt Learned and Orthodox Chriſtians. And by theſe Rules I doubt not but to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Parable of the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers has no Relation to the caſe of a Late or Death-bed Repentance. It was certainly another, and a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing, which was intended by it: I mean, the calling of the Jews and Gentiles into the Church at different Times, and in ſeveral Ages of the World; and not the Repentance of particular Perſons at this or that time of their Lives. If this can be made
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60756:66"/>out, then I think it will ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that a Death-bed Repentance has no encouragement from the Text, as having no relation to it.</p>
               <p>To make this matter as clear as I can, I ſhall lay down theſe following Propoſitions;</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Prop.</hi> That by the Lord of the Vineyards hiring Labourers into his Vineyard, is meant God's calling men into the Church, and entring into a Covenant with them to reward thoſe that ſhould be faithful in his Service. The Church, we know, is frequently compared to a Vineyard both in the Old and New Teſtament, and God is called ſometimes the Lord, ſometimes the Husbandman or Dreſſer of it. Thus, Iſa. 5.4. <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that I have not done for it?</hi> And that this Vineyard was the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is expreſly ſaid, verſ. 7. <hi>For the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts is the Church of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the men of</hi> Judah <hi>his pleaſant Plant.</hi> And in this ſtyle our Saviour expreſſes himſelf, John 15.1. <hi>I am the Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60756:66"/>his Church is the Vineyard: For ſince he uſes the ſame compariſon which the Jewiſh Church had been accuſtomed to, his Diſcourſes upon it had been loſt upon the Hearers, if he had not uſed it in the ſame ſenſe which the Prophets did. And then, if the Vineyard in the Parable be the Church of God, his hiring Labourers into it, will very naturally ſignifie his calling men out of the Heathen World to his Peculiar Service, and Covenanting with them to Reward their Obedience to him. And by conſequence,</p>
               <p n="2">2d. <hi>Prop.</hi> The ſeveral hours of hiring Labourers into the Vineyards, do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſeveral General Calls by the which God is pleaſed to invite men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church and Service in different Ages, according to the various Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of his Grace and Goodneſs. Thus he called the Jews, the Seed of <hi>Abraham, his Friend,</hi> betimes in the Morning, and agreed with them for their Service in the Covenant which he made with them at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> The mean while, and many Ages after this, the Gentiles ſtood idle, and then in the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60756:67"/>Fulneſs of time, when the Day was far ſpent, he called them to work in his Vineyard upon the Gracious Terms and Conditions of the Goſpel. And beſides theſe, we may juſtly expect another Solemn and General Calling of the Jews, who left the Vineyard when the Gentiles entred into it, excluding themſelves through Unbelief: And this, by the beſt Light we have from the Goſpel, ſeems to be reſerved for the cloſe of the Day, or the Eleventh Hour in the Parable, <hi>i.e.</hi> to ſome or other of the laſt Ages of the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. <hi>Prop.</hi> The Time of God's Calling men into the Church, be it Early or Late, makes no difference in the reward they ſhall finally receive for their faithful and diligent Service to him. For ſo it is expreſly ſaid, that the Labourers that were hired about the Eleventh Hour, received equal Wages with thoſe that were long before them in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and had done a great deal of their Maſters Buſineſs, while they were wretchedly Idle, and Unſerviceable to him. And hence, how readily does this Truth offer it ſelf to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60756:67"/>of every candid and judicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer into the meaning of this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? <hi>viz.</hi> that the Gentiles, who came late into the Church of God, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Jews; who were not called into the Vineyard till the Heat of the Day was over, and were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Covenant of Life and Peace many Ages after it was ratified to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhall yet enjoy the full benefit of it, and aſſuredly receive the ſame Reward of Eternal Life which was promiſed to the Faithful and obedient Iſraelites. And the ſame reaſon there is to believe, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall pleaſe God to call in the Unbelieving Jews, or any of the Nations that never yet beheld the great light of the Goſpel, their late entrance into the Vineyard ſhall not bar them of an equal Reward with thoſe, that have finiſht their Work, and are long ſince gone to Heaven before them.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the true Meaning and Importance of the Parable, and to have in many reſpects the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of that which ſtands in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with it: Which will more fully appear, if we try them by the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60756:68"/>Rules before mentioned, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Riſe and Occaſion of this Parable, or the Dependance it hath upon the Words which our Saviour ſpake immediately before it:<note place="margin">Chap. 19. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Many that are Firſt ſhall be Laſt, and the Laſt ſhall be Firſt:</hi> Whereupon it follows, <hi>For the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that went out early in the Morning to hire Labourers into his Vineyard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 20. 16.</note> &amp;c. And 'tis very obſervable that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour cloſes his Parable with the ſame ſaying which gave occaſion to it; and then I am ſure, that can be no Good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it, which does not ſquare with this ſaying: And certainly the trueſt (if any choice there be) is that which ſalls in moſt naturally with it.</p>
               <p>Now to put the matter upon this Iſſue: By the Labourers we underſtand the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches: And whereas our Saviour tells, that <hi>the Laſt ſhall be Firſt, and the Firſt Laſt,</hi> ſo the Gentiles that were hired laſt into the Vineyard, were the firſt in the Kingdom of Chriſt; and the Jews, who were firſt called will be the Laſt, being caſt off for rejecting the Son,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.38.</note> whom the Lord
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60756:68"/>of the Vineyard ſent to receive the Fruits of it in their Seaſon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 25.</note> till the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gentiles be come in. And thus our Lord himſelf interprets this very paſſage, Mat. 8.11, 12. <hi>Many ſhall come from the</hi> Eaſt <hi>and</hi> Weſt, <hi>and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven: But the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom</hi> (the Unbelieving Jews, that reject the Goſpel) <hi>ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs.</hi> Thus far there is a manifeſt congruity between the ſenſe which I have given of this Text, and that remarkable Sentence which our Saviour ſeems to have plac'd at both ends of the Parable, purpoſely to guide us through the meaning of it. Let us ſee now, how the Opinion of thoſe that expound it of Dying Penitents, will ſute with their being in the Firſt Rank of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Can they be ſaid to be firſt in the Kingdom of God (unleſs in the ſenſe that <hi>Judas</hi> was) who are Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to him till their laſt hour? Or do they do him better or longer Service than others, that defer their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance till they can do nothing but ask his Forgiveneſs for what they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60756:69"/>done in contradiction to him? It is to be hoped that there are men, that for many years, from their Youth to their Dying Day, have lived in the ſear of God, and a conſtant exerciſe of Virtue and Piety; and ſhall we ſay, that the beſt of theſe come behind thoſe who live as long without God in the World, till they come to the very edge and point of Eternity? I confeſs I cannot imagine what conſtruction theſe men can make of our Saviours Prophecy <hi>[So the Laſt ſhall be Firſt, and the Firſt Laſt]</hi> unleſs they will venture to ſay, that the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, who begin not to look towards God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion till their laſt ſickneſs, are before others in his Faviour, and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expect a greater reward than ſuch as ſpend their whole lives in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Which, were it true, I grant would be a mighty credit and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to a Death-bed Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we view the Context, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Thread of our Saviours Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,<note place="margin">V. 11, 12.</note> we ſhall find that the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers that came firſt into the Vineyard, murmured at the Good-man of the Houſe for making the laſt equal with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60756:69"/>themſelves, who had borne the burden and heat of the day. Now this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly true of the Jews, who repined mightily at the Gentiles coming into the Church upon all advantages imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, being entiteled to the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, without obſerving the Rites, or feeling any of the Burdens which they themſelves had ſo many Ages laboured under. Nay, this raiſed their Envy ſo high, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of it as the great impediment to their Converſion, the main thing that hindred their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual cloſing with the Goſpel. But ſtill there was great reaſon for what was done, ſuppoſing the Jews to be the Early, and the Gentiles the Late Comers into the Vineyard. For tho the World was growing old when the Gentiles were called, yet are we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally called as young as the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were, and may work as long in the Vineyard, and perform as much and as faithful Service as they did: And therefore our coming after them can be no reaſon, why our Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould not reward us as liberally to the full, as them. He that does a Days-work the laſt day of the year, if he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60756:70"/>was called to it no ſooner, deſerves a Days-wages as well as he that was hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the firſt. But I hope no man will ſay, there is the ſame reaſon why a Death-bed ſorrow, after ten thouſand Calls to Repentance and Newneſs of Life, ſhould be equally rewarded with the longeſt holy and moſt religious Life. However, that our Saviour was not of this mind, may appear,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we conſider the plain ſcope and meaning of other Parables; ſuch as that of the five Fooliſh Virgins, who wanted Oyle in their Lamps at the Bridegrooms coming,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10, 11, 12.</note> and while they went to buy, were barred out of his Preſence, which the Wiſe were admitted into; and when they cryed, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> (methinks I hear the Sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death-bed Cry!) received this Dreadful Anſwer, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi> And as little coherence will be found between a Dying Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents being equally rewarded with the moſt Eminent Chriſtians (as he muſt be, if we rank him with the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Text) and the Parable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Talents, the Moral of which is apparently this, that good men
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60756:70"/>ſhall be rewarded according to the good they have done, and the ſeveral advantages they were entruſted with; and they that have done none, but ſquandred away their Lives and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuities of Grace, ſhall feel the high diſpleaſure of God, and with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servant be caſt into outer darkneſs. Let men impartially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe eaſie and obvious things, and they will aſſuredly find but ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to build their hopes of Eternal Life upon any ſtruggle or remorſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at their Death, which few bad men (that have any tolerable ſenſe of another World) are, and even <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> himſelf was not exempted from.</p>
               <p n="4">4th <hi>Prop.</hi> The fourth and laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, Were we ſure that the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Labourers at the eleventh hour, did ſignifie the late calling of Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians to the Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Goſpel, yet this will not reach the caſe of a Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. There is a manifeſt diſparity between them in ſeveral reſpects. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that were called ſo late as the eleventh hour, were guilty of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60756:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>but embraced the firſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they had of labouring in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. The reaſon they gave why they ſtood ſo long Idle in the Market, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>no man had hired them,</hi> implies that they were ready to be imployed,<note place="margin">V. 7.</note> and that they chearfully cloſed with the firſt invitation that was offered to them; and ſo doing they were not to be blamed that they were not earlier at work. For this is as much as <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Jewiſh Church, or the Apoſtles, the firſt Labourers in the Chriſtian, did. They came as ſoon as their Lord called them, tho they were not in the Vineyard till the middle age of their Lives. And I doubt not, if a poor Indian, that never heard of Chriſt till he entred upon the laſt ſtage of his Life, ſhall then become a ſerious and faithful Chriſtian, but that his reward will be great in Heaven. But this is not the caſe of thoſe who were devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Service of God in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, who have lived many years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the miniſtry of his Sacred Word, and the obligations of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Who have reſiſted the motions of the Bleſſed Spirit, and the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60756:71"/>of Parents and Friends, never hearkning unto any till the Rough Meſſenger of Death comes, and tells them roundly in their Ears, that now they muſt die and away to Judgment. And 'tis no wonder they are then ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they ſpent their time ſo ill, while Hell and Deſtruction look them in the Face, but they cannot but ſay they had fair and frequent Warnings to have uſed it better.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They who came ſo late into the Vineyard, had yet one hour of Trial; and this, in proportion to the Day which God allows us to work out our Salvation in, is the twelfth part of our Lives. 'Tis true, this is but a ſhort time, conſidering what engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we are under of ſerving our Creator and Redeemer all the days of our Lives; but ſtill it is much longer, than a Sinner who defers his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to his Death, allows himſelf to do the whole work of Religion, to break the habits of Vice, to exerciſe all the virtues of the Chriſtian Life, and to put himſelf into a poſture for Eternity. He vows perhaps, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares upon the word of a Dying-man
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60756:72"/>what great things he would do; but alas his Breath goes away with his Vows, and gives him not a minute to prove his Sincerity in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt Comers into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard wrought an hour, and therein performed the whole Duty they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for. But what is this to the purpoſe of men that work not at all? For furely to ask pardon for what they have not done, to be ſorry for what they have, or to reſolve to do better if they had opportunity, will not bring them within the notion of Labourers, and then it cannot intitle them to the reward. This is the ſtate of Dying Penitents; their whole work lies upon their hands, and that's the ground of all their Sorrow, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to work (if it were not too late) which therefore are not working; and to ſuppoſe that God will accept them as if they were, is to ſay that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Vineyard, who was all the day hiring Labourers into it, was very indifferent what they did there, and would ſurely have been as Bountiful (if there had been occaſion) to thoſe that did him no ſervice, as to them that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60756:72"/>did the moſt, provided they were but ſorry they had not ſerv'd him at all, and were willing to work juſt when Night came, and forbid them.</p>
               <p>And thus, I think, I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved that this Parable has no Relation to the Caſe of a late, or Death-bed Repentance; which was the Firſt General propounded to be ſpoken to. The ſecond was,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is no other ground of Aſſurance in the Goſpel, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of a Dying Chriſtian, after a whole Life ſpent in Sin, and an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Violation of his Baptiſmal Vow and Covenant, will ſecure him of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation. That the Goſpel gives no ſuch Encouragement to Men that Trifle with the Grace of God; we may be as ſure, as we can be, that the Goſpel does not contradict it ſelf; and that not in trivial Inſtances, but in the great and moſt eſſential parts of it, I mean, the deſign of its being revealed to men, and the conditions it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them in order to Eternal Life and Happineſs. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Did the Goſpel aſſure us, that God will accept of Dying Vows and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60756:73"/>inſtead of a Life of Virtue and Holineſs, it would ſhew us a notable way to evade and overthrow its own great and admirable Deſign, the very end for which it appeared unto men; which was to teach and oblige us to lead holy and virtuous Lives, to deny <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Wordly Luſts, and to live Soberly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Righteouſly and Godlily in this preſent World;</hi> while we are reſident here, and capable of doing Service to God and Men. This is the end of all the Inſtitutions of the Goſpel, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of our Baptiſm, by which we are amitted into Covenant with God: For therefore (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>we are buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead by the Glory of the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4.</note> 
                  <hi>even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of Life: i. e.</hi> From our firſt entrance into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, till we have finiſht our Courſe, and are got beyond the Dangers and Temptations of this ſinful World. But where is this New Life, when we are juſt a Dying? Do we anſwer the end of our Baptiſm, tho we never ſet a ſtep in our Chriſtian Race, till our Life is run out? Or does the Goſpel,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60756:73"/>whatever it obliges us to do, diſpence with us for not doing it? This perhaps in ſome mens Opinion would advance the Grace, but ſurely no man will ſay it commends the Wiſdom of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: For who does not ſee, that the deſign of making us Holy is loſt, ſhould the Goſpel once declare that we may be diſpenſed with for not being Holy; or, that it is enough to ſecure us of Heaven, to be truly ſorry at the laſt that we have lived wickedly all our days. And were this the true ſenſe of the Goſpel, I cannot ſee what Anſwer can be returned to thoſe that ſhould Object againſt the Author of it, that either our Sactification was not the thing he really deſign'd; or if it was, that he has taken effectual care (conſidering our natural averſeneſs to it, and the fierce and rampant inclinations to Vice, of thoſe that ſtand in greateſt need of it) to diſappoint himſelf of his end; that he has left us all the gains and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Sin, and himſelf the honour only of Pardoning our ungodly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious Lives; that we may dabble and bemire our ſelves in all the Pollutions of the Fleſh and of the World, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60756:74"/>waſh off all with a few Penitential Tears when we die; that we may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly wicked with good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the laſt, and tho we never glorified God in our Lives; be ſure to receive a Crown of Glory from him at our Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Goſpel gives no ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, is certain, becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, requires Holineſs and Obedience to the Precepts of it, as a neceſſary, condition of future Happineſs. As it deſigns the Profeſſors of it ſhould be excellent men, holy in all manner of Converſation, ſo it excludes them out of Heaven who fruſtrate its deſign by wicked and unworthy Practices, and expoſe its Bleſſed Author to Open Shame.<note place="margin">

For, can a man that is dying, be ſaid to have lived holily, only becauſe he is ſadly troubled for a very ſinful Life? Or hath he kept the Commandments, that has lived in a conſtant violation of them, and of his own Covenant to keep them, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſes over again to keep them, when it is too late? Can we can him a Mortifiect Man, that after he has
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60756:75"/>gorg'd himſelf with the pleaſures of Sin, and ſinned away the power of Luſt, reſolves yet to be very chaſte and temperate upon his Death-bed? Or can we ſay, that he ſeeks for Glory and Immortality by his Patience and Conſtancy in Well-doing, who at the end of his Natural is to begin the whole Chriſtian Life, and has always been a perfect Stranger to the Converſation of Heaven?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, thoſe that have made it their buſineſs to pleaſe God, have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſoberly, and kept a Good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards Men, need not doubt the pardon of their Offences upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for them, becauſe their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ever accompanied with actual Holineſs, and where Holineſs is the Fruit of Repentance, the End will be <hi>Everlaſting Life.</hi> But the caſe is vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different in thoſe, that have left themſelves no time to reform their lives, and are forc'd to ſpend that little they have left in fruitleſs Vows and Wiſhes: Becauſe theſe men have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the main condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the great End of the Goſpel, and of their Lives, I mean, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification

               <p>But perhaps you will ſay, tho thoſe pangs of Sorrow and Devotion, which men that have lived wretched and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate Lives diſcover on their Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, cannot be called a Holy Life, yet they are good ſigns of Repentance and Faith in Chriſt; and are they not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to intitle them to Pardon and Eternal Life? To this I Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="8">8. 'Tis certain that no true Penitent and Believer in Chriſt ſhall finally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. But then the Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Goſpel will allow that to be true ſaving Faith or Repentance, which is deſtitute of the Fruits of Rigteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after a fair ſeaſon and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for them. And here it is but fair the Goſpel ſhould ſpeak for it ſelf; <hi>Bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi>

                  <hi>If Faith without Works</hi> (as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us) <hi>is dead,</hi> how ſad is the condemnation of a dying Sinner, whoſe Faith is dead before him, and whoſe time of working is over, tho' he ſeek it with Tears? If ſorrow for Sin may be without amendment of Life, and then will not paſs for true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it can be no certain ſign of it: And if Chriſt will render to every man according to his works, how ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the caſe of that man, who has worn out his whole Life in Sin, and hardly left himſelf the leaſt remnant of time to amend it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. No man can plead any Title to the Mercy or Favour of God, but by virtue of his Covenant with him in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. 'Tis by Baptiſm that we are made Parties in the Covenant, which includes all the Promiſes God hath made to us in his Son, and therefore ought to be the Standard of our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60756:76"/>from him. And whereas there are Conditions on our part, and we vow Obedience to Chriſti's Commands, as well as Faith and Repentance from Dead Works; if we fail in any of theſe Conditions, we bar our Title to the Promiſes which depend upon them: We cut our ſelves off by our own Act and Deed, from the Hopes of Pardon and Eternal Life. For where a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made upon more Conditions than one, the keeping of all but one, will not inable us to claim the Promiſe. And why ſhould we think that God will abate us the Righteouſneſs of Faith (as the Apoſtle ſtyles Obedience to the Goſpel) or that he will accept of a ſhort Repentance in the room of it, when the Goſpel makes them equally neceſſary to Salvation, and we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for them alike in our Baptiſm? Faith indeed and Repentance are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to bring us within the verge of the Covenant: but when we are in a Covenant-ſtate, and have ſolemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to walk in the Commandments of God all our days, as we expect the fulfilling of the Promiſes to us, nothing leſs than the practice of Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60756:77"/>can juſtifie our Pretences to them. This is the Tenour of his Covenant with us; and we muſt not think, that God will be put off with the renewing of thoſe Vows at our Death, which our Lives have been a continual viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of. To which may be added,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the ſincerity of a Death-bed Repentance can never be tried, and therefore to us it cannot be known to be that Repentance which the Goſpel requires. Some Inſtances, we hope, there are of men that have made good the Vows which they made in their Sickneſs: But alas, how many of thoſe that have out-lived their own fears of Death, have out-lived the Promiſes too which they made under the Terrours of it! How often have men recovered into a wickeder Life than ever, their Sorrows been but as a Morning Cloud, and their Penitent Tears as the Early Dew, which ſoon paſſeth away?</p>
               <p>And now from what hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon this Head, it is evident, that the Device of a Death-bed Repentance hath no Foundation in the Goſpel: Nay, ſo far is it from that, that it tends to ruin the very deſign of its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60756:77"/>unto men, to Debauch the Chriſtian World, and to make Salvation cheaper (after the Direful ſufferings of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord) than the vileſt Luſt that is practiſed in it. And if this paſs for Goſpel, I confeſs, I am to learn what Powerful Arguments the Goſpel has left to prevail with the generality of its Profeſſors (who notwithſtanding their Baptiſmal Vow, do hardly ſeem to be half perſuaded to be Chriſtians) to cloſe entirely with the Precepts of it. The beſt we can offer to them are, that the Religious and Virtuous Man lives a Nobler Life, and is in a ſafer ſtate, than he that drills off his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and thinks it time enough to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form when he is Dying, becauſe he may be ſurpriſed by Death, which is a chance the other is provided againſt. But ſuddain Death happens ſo very ſeldom, and the Excellency of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life is ſo little underſtood, that conſidering the Guiſe of this World, the hardneſs of an Impenitent Heart, and the ſubtilty of the Great Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Mankind, and the violent and outragious Affections by which habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sinners are hurried on to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60756:78"/>Delights and Pleaſures, no man that hath any inſight into the Principles of Human Actions, can promiſe any competent ſucceſs, if we have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Arguments to urge than theſe. And indeed when the neceſſity of Holineſs is gone (the thing which is ſtruck at by all the Projectors of eaſie ways to Heaven) Chriſtianity muſt be a very precarious thing, a matter of Good-will, or at moſt of very Ordinary Prudence, having loſt its great Power and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Reform the World. For if the Goſpel will ſecure me of Heaven, and excuſe me for not obeying the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God all my life-long, it plainly leaves me to my liberty to do as I liſt, which is the thing my unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Nature deſires: And while I find my ſelf eaſie, and believe my ſelf ſafe in this way, I muſt be under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible prejudice againſt any other that can be recommended to me: 'Tis not Arguing that will reach me now; 'tis not Dry Reaſon that will work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. Oh Bleſſed Jeſus! how many ways have men invented to ſhift off their Obedience to thy Commandments! But, how can I think that thou cam'ſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60756:78"/>to turn me from my ſins, if parting ſorrowfully with them when I die, be enough to bring me into the Joys of thy Heavenly Kingdom!</p>
               <p>It is time now to draw to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: But I fear you will hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, if I ſhould not ſtay to anſwer a Queſtion or two in behalf of poor Dying Penitents.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, May not God in a moment diſſolve the hardeſt and moſt impenitent Heart, and caſt it into a new Frame, whenever he is pleaſed to ſhew the Riches of his Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Veſſels of Wrath fitted for Deſtruction? And whom he Sanctifies, will he not Save? Theſe, I grant, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Truths, But then we are not ſpeaking of what God can do, or may have done in ſome extraordinary caſes: But the Queſtion is, What he has Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed? And when he has given us a Rule to walk by, and declared he will Judge us according to it, whether he will think fit to vary from this Rule? If he will not, 'tis ſadly evident that a Late Repentance is the moſt Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Adventure in the World; and that he will, he has no where told
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60756:79"/>us, and therefore we can have not Reaſon to Preſume upon it. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Did not the Penitent Thief go immediately from the Croſs into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice? True, but did not <hi>Judas</hi> alſo Repent, and reſtore the Mony he had taken to Betray his Maſter, and after that go to his Own Place? Was not <hi>Judas</hi> a Profeſt Diſciple, and the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Thief a Stranger to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Goſpel? And which of theſe does moſt reſemble the caſe of Delaying Penitents? They are, I grant, in no danger of being guilty of <hi>Judas</hi> his ſin, but neither are they in condition of making ſo Glorious a Confeſſion as the Penitent Thief did, when he ſaw the Saviour of the World hanging upon the Croſs. Both theſe are extraordinary caſes, one of which may ſerve indeed to ballance the other, but then we cannot certainly conclude our Good or Bad Condition from either.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, If the ſtate of Dying Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents be thus Diſconſolate, what roome is there to offer any Advice or Comfort to them? I anſwer, it does not become us to limit the Grace and Mercy of God, which is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60756:79"/>of all our Hopes; or to ſay that he cannot extend it beyond the Terms of his Covenant with us. He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is Good; but break not thou into his Secrets: He has probably more Mercy in ſtore than he has promiſed to beſtow, and it is to be hoped the Penitent Thief has not exhauſted the whole Treaſure. Nor do I know any Reaſon we have to think, that extraordinary Grace is more inconſiſtent with the End and Honour of the Divine Government and Perfections, than it is with the Honour and Good Government of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Merciful Princes, when they find reaſon to over-rule the Sentence of their own Juſt and Righteous Laws. And me-thinks it is ſome comfort, that Good Men are generally diſpoſed to hope well of thoſe, whoſe Repentance at any time is ſignal and extraordinary. And tho all this does not mount to a ſure Ground of Hope, yet it is ſuch a one as ought to encourage Dying Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to all poſſible degrees of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Repentance. This is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beſt uſe they can put their laſt minutes to: If they Repent not from
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60756:80"/>the very center and bottom of their Souls, their Damnation is irreverſibly Sealed: If they do, we muſt leave them to the Mercy and Compaſſion of God: And tho we cannot promiſe them Eternal Life without the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, becauſe we have no Authority from the Goſpel to do it, yet we may and ought to remind them that there are ſome Monuments of a Miraculous Grace, ſome Inſtances in which the Goodneſs of God has Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over the utmoſt Spight and Obſtinacy of Inſolent and Malicious Offenders; and that the greater their Contrition is, the meeter Objects they are of his Infinite Pity and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Works of his own Hands.</p>
               <p>This, I confeſs, is but ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in compariſon of what they might have enjoyed, had they lived in the Faith and Fear of God; but it is ſuch as the caſe will bear: And if Men ſin beyond the Stated Meaſures of Grace and Mercy in the Goſpel, they muſt thank themſelves if it will not afford them better: But they muſt not be angry with the Preachers of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they dare not go beyond their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60756:80"/>Commiſſion, and have more kindneſs for them than to flatter them into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments.</p>
               <p>Now what is the proper uſe of this Diſcourſe? But that knowing the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy and Danger of a Death-bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, we ſhould hence learn the Wiſdom of applying our ſelves betimes to the Service of God and Religion, and ſecuring our Souls while he puts it into our power to do it. 'Tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing, that men ſhould give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all their Vigorous Years to Luſt and Vanity, the pleaſures of which are but for a moment, and yet hope to do a Work that ſhall ſtand good to Eternity in a few ſickly and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hours. What ſtrange Riddle and Infatuation is this? But it is not enough to diſcern the miſtakes of others, and diſapprove of their methods to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and ruine themſelves, while we neglect our own ſafety, and content our ſelves with knowing where our plain Duty and Intereſt lies. Let us therefore grow wiſe by their Example, and the loud and importunate Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which they give their Friends, when they can have no deſign upon
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60756:81"/>them, but to keep them from the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which they endure.</p>
               <p>We have at moſt but a ſhort time to be in this World, and every day we delay our Repentance, beſides the hazzard we run by it, we certainly make our Work ſo much the heavier the day after: For ſtill we have the more Sins to Repent of, and we have a worſe Nature to ſtruggle with; and ſhould we delay on to our dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day, what a World of Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould we treaſure up for our ſelves againſt our laſt hour, when of all others we ſhall be the leaſt able to hear it? And when all this is done, we cannot aſſure our ſelves that God will regard our Sorrows, any more than we have done his Calls to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation of Life.</p>
               <p>Would we conſider things as we are ſure to find them, certainly we ſhould not chooſe to leave them at this paſs, and to have no better hopes than a Condemned Malefactor has, <hi>viz.</hi> that tho by Law he is to dye, yet he may poſſibly be ſaved by the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his Prince, whoſe Crown and Dignity, till he fell into his Hands, he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60756:81"/>was always an utter and declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to. No wiſe man would hazzard his Life upon ſuch a contingency: And can there be ſtarker madneſs than to venture our Souls upon the like Iſſue, by continuing in an Impenitent State till we are leaving the World, in hopes that God will be better than his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and when the Goſpel condemns us, ſave us by a reſerve of Prerogative Grace?</p>
               <p>Let us therefore Repent of our Sins while we may be ſure of Pardon for them, and not ſtay till it is too late, which would be a Repentance for ever to be repented of. Let us conſider what a diſmal thing it would be, when we are Dying, to have our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences flying in our Faces, and accuſing us at once of a whole Life ſpent in wickedneſs and contradiction to our Chriſtian Profeſſion. And ſince we cannot ſee God without Holineſs, and therefore cannot Die with any True Peace and Comfort without it, let us reſolve, without any further delay, to break off our Sins, and apply our ſelves to the exerciſe of all Chriſtian Virtues and Graces. Let us every day, as we
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60756:82"/>draw nearer to Eternity, mind the concernments of it with that zeal and ſincerity, that we ſhall heartily wiſh we had done, when we lie panting and breathing out our Souls into a ſtate of Immortality. In ſhort, let us make our Death-beds as ſoft and eaſie as we can, I mean, by doing our great Work beforehand, and leaving our ſelves nothing to do there but to dye: This is the way, when we are tired out with the Cares and Vanities of this Toilſom Life, to find the ſweeteſt repoſe upon them: To Die in Peace, and to Finiſh our Courſe with Joy, and then our Reſt will be Glorious. I ſhall conclude all with the words of the Apoſtle, by which we may judge of the Truth and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Diſcourſe, <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>For whatſoever a man Soweth, that ſhall he alſo Reap; He that ſoweth to the Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption; but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life Everlaſting.</hi> Which God grant we may all do, through the Infinite Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>'TIS evident from many paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this Epiſtle, that the Chriſtian Jews, to whom it was written, began to faulter in the Brofeſſion of Chriſtianity, and to be in great danger of revolting to their Old Religion. Hereupon the Apoſtle, who, 'tis probable, had been Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to their change, endeavours to ſettle and confirm them in it. And whereas
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60756:83"/>the fear of ſuffering Perſecution was the great thing that ſtagger'd the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Chriſtians, he ſhews them at large in the Eleventh Chapter, that the Faith of the Holy Men of Old did uſe to raiſe them above any ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements; and then propoſes the Example of our Bleſſed Saviour, the Greateſt ſufferer, and the moſt Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Pattern of Fortitude and Patience, in the Second and Third Verſes of this Chapter. After this he endeavours to raiſe the Spirits of the dejected He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, and reconcile them to a ſtate of Perſecution, by reminding them, that Afflictions are no Arguments of God's Hatred or Deſertion of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;<note place="margin">Verſ. 5, to 10.</note> but rather of his Paternal Love and Peculiar Tenderneſs towards them;<note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> and tho they ſeem Harſh and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous for the preſent, yet in their Effects they are very Kind and Grateful, as <hi>yielding the Peaceable Fruits of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Pleaſure and Tranquility of Mind in this World, and Eternal Reſt and Glory in that which is to come. Then follows the Exhortation, of which the Text is part, <hi>Wherefore lift up the Hands which hang down, and the feeble
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60756:83"/>Knees, and make ſtreight Paths for your Feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Paths</hi> we are to underſtand the General Courſe of our Actions; which are then <hi>Streight,</hi> when they lie even with the Rule that God has given us to Frame and Govern them by. For ſtreightneſs has a neceſſary relation to a Rule, and conſiſts in an evenneſs or adequate conformity to it. And then we do make our <hi>Paths ſtreight,</hi> when we take due care to underſtand our Rule, and being well aſſured of the rectitude of it, to order our Actions ſo as to make them Anſwerable to it; and when we have begun well, to hold on our Courſe without any ſtop or deviation from it. Now the Goſpel being the Rule of the Chriſtian Life, the meaning of the Apoſtles Exhortation to the Hebrews, who began to waver in the Profeſſion of it, muſt be this: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Streight and Perfect Rule before you, ſee that your Actions be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it: Don't faint at any Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, or follow any crooked and deceitful Paths, but keep to them that are ſtreight, as the Goſpel leads you, which is the Direct and Infallible
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60756:84"/>Way to Everlaſting Bliſs and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>From the Words thus explained, there are three things obſervable, of which I ſhall ſpeak in their order.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That there is a Streight and Direct way to Heaven and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
                  <item>2. That this Way may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly found with due care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</item>
                  <item>3. That having found the Streight Way to Heaven, we ought to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful and exact in walking in it, and not yield to any Temptation to forſake it.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That there is a ſtreight and direct Way to Heaven and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is ſuppoſed in the Text, which exhorts the Hebrews to make uſe of this Way, and implies that they were already in ſome meaſure acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. And well might the Apoſtle ſuppoſe that there is ſuch a Way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being at the pains to prove it, when it is univerſally owned by all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is any ſuch thing as True Religion in the World; and that is all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60756:84"/>the World but the Atheiſt, that is of no Religion. Very many indeed are miſtaken in their Way to Heaven: But that there is a ſtreight and certain Way thither, was never denied by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of any Religion; for they all pretend to be in the Right Way, how wide ſoever they are in Opinion and Practice from one another. All the Controverſie is, which of thoſe ſeveral Paths which men take to be the ſtreight and plain Way to Heaven, is truly ſo. And certainly to know this, is a matter of very great concernment, and deſerves a very ſerious and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Enquiry, for tho a man may fall into the right way by chance, that never enquires after it (which is the caſe of thoſe that Profeſs the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for no other reaſon, but becauſe they were inſtructed in it from their Infancy) yet 'tis no virtue in ſuch a man that he is in the right: Nay, he does not ſo much as know that he is, and ſo long is in danger of being toſs'd about, and carried off from one Church and Religion to another, according as the Wind of Doctrine ſits, and the Tide of Preferment turns. He that takes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60756:85"/>his Religion upon Truſt, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines the Grounds and Reaſons of it, may be eaſily perſuaded that he has no Reaſon to be Obſtinate in it, eſpecially when he is like to be a loſer by the hand, and is fairly offered another that promiſes <hi>the Life that now is,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give Infallible Security for <hi>that which is to come.</hi> And hence St. <hi>Peter</hi> admoniſheth the Chriſtians that fled out of <hi>Judea</hi> for the freedom of their Religion,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.</note> to <hi>be always ready to give an Anſwer to every man that ſhould ask</hi> them <hi>a Reaſon of the Hope that is in</hi> them; <hi>i. e.</hi> to be able to defend their Religion and themſelves, by declaring (as often as their Adverſaries urged them to it) what certain Grounds and Reaſons they had for it. And in truth a Religion without Rational Grounds and Motives to induce us to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Practice of it, is not worth the ſuffering or contending for.</p>
               <p>But perhaps it will be ſaid, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is a ſtreight and ſure way to Happineſs, yet there is ſuch variety of differing Opinions and Perſuaſions about it, that it is hardly poſſible to be certain where it is, or when we have
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60756:85"/>found it. There are ſo many ſeveral Paths, each of which are taken to be the right by thoſe that are accuſtomed to them (which yet can never be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they apparently croſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that let a man be never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the Goodneſs of his Way, there are others who, are no leſs confident that he is in a wrong Path, and muſt come over to them if he will ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf right, and timely prevent his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Errors. And ſince there is ſo great a diverſity of Methods in Religion, and ſo great a Confidence on both ſides, how is it poſſible for a plain man, that would fain go the neareſt and the ſtreighteſt way to Heaven, to be ſure to find it? Thus the Sceptick argues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the certainty of Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the Romaniſt thinks there is no Argument like this to confound the Proteſtants, and to prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an Infallible Guide.</p>
               <p>But ſtill I hope there is no great hurt in this Argument, and that a plain man may be ſure of finding his way to Heaven, after all the Miſtakes and Controverſies that there are about it, tho there ſhould be no ſuch thing as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60756:86"/>an Infallible Guide on Earth. And this I ſhall endeavour to clear in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſecond Propoſition, evidently implied in the Text, which is this;</p>
               <p n="2">2d. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the ſtreight way to Heaven may be certainly found with due care and enquiry; I mean, by men of ordinary capacity, ſincerely uſing the means which God is pleaſed to afford them, without the aſſiſtance of any Earthly Infallible Guide. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in vain did the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the Hebrews to <hi>make ſtreight Paths</hi> for their <hi>Feet:</hi> For, ſuppoſing them uncapable of diſcerning between ſtreight and crooked Paths, either for want of a Rule to guide them, or a faculty to apply their Rule to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways that were propoſed to them, it was to no purpoſe to give them any advice in this matter. They that muſt judge of their Guides by the Rule of Scripture (as all Chriſtians are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do) muſt judge of their Rule firſt: And they that cannot judge of a ſtreight Rule, when it lies before them, cannot judge of an Infallible Guide: As he that has not the wit to know
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60756:86"/>when a Line is ſtreight, can be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge of a Perfect Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician.</p>
               <p>For the fuller explication of this Truth, it may be proper to premiſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by the ſtreight way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I underſtand (as it is plain the Author of this Epiſtle does) the way which God hath revealed in his Goſpel; the ſame which is there called the <hi>way that leadeth unto Life;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.14.22.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20</note> 
                  <hi>the way of God in Truth; the way of Salvation, the right way, the new and living way which Chriſt hath conſecrated for us;</hi> that is, the Method which the Son of God, by his Incarnation and Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel hath put us into for the attainment of Everlaſting Life and Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the ſure finding of this Way upon a due and careful enquiry, I mean, that Ordinary Chriſtians by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelves to the ſtudy of the Scriptures (the Sacred Records of our Religion) with a clear and honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, by imploring the Divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiſtance, and making that uſe they ought of their Spiritual Guides, may certainly attain to the knowledge of all the Truths which are neceſſary to be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60756:87"/>believed, and of the Duties required of them to be done in order to their Eternal Salvation. And this is as much as any man, that is ſincerely inquiſitive after the Way to Heaven, can deſire: For who that is ſo, can deſire to be more than certain of his way thither? Or to have a better Foundation for his Faith and Practice, than the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God himſelf; who, if there be any ſuch thing as Infallibity in men, muſt be the Author of it?</p>
               <p>Now to prove that we may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our way to Heaven without the help of an Infallible Guide, I ſhall endeavour to make good theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſertions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Bleſſed Author of our Religion hath left us a certain Rule to direct us to Eternal Life. That there is ſuch a Rule, is as evident as that the Goſpel is the Word of God, or that the Doctrine of Chriſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Writings of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and Apoſtles. And in this all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are agreed: Even the Romaniſts themſelves allow the Scripture to be the Infallible Rule, tho they are no great Friends to the Uſefulneſs or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60756:87"/>of it. But ſtill we have a greater Authority than this, I mean that of the Scriptures themſelves, which declare that they were <hi>written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. <hi>10.</hi> ult.</note> 
                  <hi>that we might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> to be the Rule of our Chriſtian Faith] <hi>and that Believing we might have Life through his Name:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12.</note> That they teach us a Rule of Life, and are <hi>able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note> And hence the Primitive Fathers and the Firſt General Councils appealed to the Scriptures as the True Standard of Chriſtianity, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Ancient Hereticks by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of them. In thoſe days the manner was to ſet the Holy Oracles in the midſt of the Councils, to ſignifie that they ought to be conſulted in all their Debates, and that nothing ought to be impoſed upon the Faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or decreed to be an Article of Religion, but what may be found in the Goſpel, and is ſo determined by that Infallible Rule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt having left ſuch a Rule to his Church, it muſt be ſuppoſed to be Intelligible, <hi>i. e.</hi> capable of being
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60756:88"/>underſtood and applied by thoſe that are to uſe it as a Rule. Otherwiſe it can never ſerve the Great End it was given for; to ſay which is the higheſt Reflexion that can be upon the Wiſdom of him that gave it. The Goſpel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſhew us a ſtreight way to Heaven, but to what purpoſe, if we can never find it by its directions? If we muſt uſe it as a Rule, we muſt learn from it what we are to believe and practiſe: And if we muſt do ſo, I think that is a plain and unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument that we may do it: For aſſuredly God would never make a ſhew of bringing us to Heaven by a Means, which, he certainly knows would fail us, if we truſt to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Inſtitution of Paſtors and Miniſters in the Church for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of private perſons in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Rule, undeniably proves that our Saviours meaning was, that all Chriſtians ſhould underſtand it themſelves: And then it is evident they may do it, ſo far as they are concern'd, and are qualified to judge in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For what uſe is there of Teachers, but to aſſiſt and inform our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60756:88"/>and help us to make a Right Judgment of Things? Or what benefit is there of being taught, if we may not uſe our Judgment when it is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed, and be permitted to know when it is, and when not? This, I am ſure, is the natural priviledge of Mankind; and I do not know one natural right that our Saviour by any Inſtitution of his deprives us of: And certainly of all others he would never bar us of this, becauſe his Doctrine would be of little uſe to us without it. For what ſway is the Goſpel like to bear upon our Minds; or which way can it influence our lives, till we know the true Senſe and Uſes of it, which it is impoſſible we ſhould, unleſs we may exerciſe our own Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them? Let my Guide be never ſo Knowing or Infallible, 'tis not his, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my own knowledge, that can make me ſure of my way: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unleſs he has a way to conveigh his Great Knowledge into me, (and if he has, it is ſurely through my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) I am but juſt where I was without him, and never like to make any Spiritual Improvement by
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60756:89"/>him. 'Tis the Intereſt, I confeſs, of ſome Teachers, that their Diſciples ſhould not ſee which way they lead them: But thoſe whom Chriſt hath ordained to this Office, are <hi>ſent to open their Eyes, and to turn them from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto Light,</hi> that they themſelves may ſee the things which belong to their Eternal Peace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſtians, without diſtinction, are expreſly required to <hi>ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and to <hi>prove all things</hi> by them, as the Rule and Standard of Truth and certainty in matters of Religion. <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life,</hi> John 5.39. implying, that as there is a Treaſure in the Scriptures, a clear diſcovery of the Way to Eternal Life, ſo it may be certainly found by thoſe that duly ſearch for it: And if it may be found in the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, to which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here directs his Diſciples, there can be no reaſon we ſhould deſpair of finding it in the New, being infallibly aſſured,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</note> that <hi>Life and Immortality</hi> were <hi>brought to the Light of the Goſpel, i.e.</hi> were more Emphatically Diſcovered,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60756:89"/>being ſet in a better Light to us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by the New and Brighter Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Goſpel, than they were of Old to the Jews by all the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. And then, if we ſeek for Life and Immortality, and follow the directions of this Greater Light, we may be ſure to make Streight Paths for our Feet, till we come to the Perfect Fruition of them. Nor are we commanded only to ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but to <hi>prove all things</hi> by them, to <hi>try the Spirits whether they be of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.57</note> and to <hi>judge of our ſelves what is Right:</hi> That is, we muſt uſe our own Reaſon and Judgment in comparing matters in Controverſie with the Infallible Rule of Scripture: For ſome Rule we muſt have to Prove, and Try, and Judge by: And it is plain, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture takes no notice of any other Rule but it ſelf; and that of Modern and Unwritten Tradition, as Oppoſite to it. And this is ſecurity enough againſt any Dangerous Error, conſidering that the Goſpel is as much a ſtanding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to the Chriſtian Church, as the Law and the Prophets were to the Jews.</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:60756:90"/>
               <p n="5">5. We find the happy Effect of this Courſe ſo far, that perſons of ordinary capacity, after a competent Trial of it, do rightly believe and underſtand all that is neceſſary to their Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The neceſſary Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are ſo viſible in the Scriptures, that it is the hardeſt thing that can be for an Ingenious Reader to overlook them. That there is but One God; that He only ought to be Worſhipped; that he ſent his Only Begotten to Die for us; that he Died and Roſe again; that as many as Repent of their Sins, Believe and Obey the Goſpel, ſhall be Saved: Theſe and other Principles of Religion are ſo clearly and fully expreſt in Scripture, that there is no need of an Infallible Interpreter to certifie for them: A common Underſtanding with the ordinary Means of Knowledge can reach the Diſcovery, I mean, without the help of a Roman Teleſcope, or ſtanding upon the Shoulders of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>'s pretended Succeſſor. This we know the Certainty of, we feel it in our ſelves, and we ſee the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in ten thouſand Inſtances, and do not think the worſe of our
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60756:90"/>Faith for being Proteſtant, <hi>i. e.</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Grounded upon the Evidence and Authority of Scripture: We look upon it as our Inviolable Birth right to judge of Plain Truths when we ſee them: And for this we have the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſe of Mankind on our ſide, and cannot think it reaſonable to put it to any man to judge for us, whether or no there is a God, a Chriſt, or a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That all neceſſary Truths are plain, is allowed by all Chriſtians but thoſe that make Articles of Faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, which are ſo far from being plain, that there is not the leaſt mention of them in the whole Goſpel. And if all things that are Neceſſary, are Plain, then (I hope) a plain man may judge of them, and without asking leave of any other man may believe them; and ſo doing he certainly is in a ſtate of Salvation: And then the Church that declares he is not, cannot be Infallible, unleſs a Church can Err, and be Infallible at the ſame inſtant.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is far eaſier for men, (who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Direction of God, and uſe the Helps which he affords them) to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60756:91"/>find their way to Heaven in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, than to find an Infallible Guide on Earth to lead them to it. It muſt be granted, that there are Obſcure, as well as Plain Paſſages in Scripture: Some Places ſo very Dark and Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that they even Poſe the moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and judicious Guides: But thn our Happineſs is, that our Way does not lie Thorough them, and that there is Light enough in innumerable other places to direct our Steps, and to bring us in a Streight Line to Everlaſting Bliſs and Perfection. I do not ſay, that every thing tht concerns our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is ſo clearly revealed, that no man can be ignorant of it: But that we may know as much as is needful for us, if we apply our minds to it, and laying aſide all prejudice againſt the Truth, beg of God to Preſerve us from Error; all which we have great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to do, ſince he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us the aſſiſtance of his Spirit in the ſearch of Truth.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed offers to put us into a ſhorter and eaſier Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of finding out Truth, and to bring us to a Guide that will Infallibly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60756:91"/>ſhew us every ſtep of our way: So that we need not be at the Pains of any Tedious Inquiries, nor any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in danger of miſſing our Aim in them, through the weakneſs of our own Fallible Judgments. And who would not gladly embrace ſo Free and kind an Offer as this, provided there be no Trick or Fallacy it it? The Tryal of which will appear, if the Propoſes of this way of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be able to ſatisfy us in a few rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Caſes, without which (as great as the Courteſy ſeems to be) we cnnot prudently Accept of their Offer. If a man ſhould freely proffer me the <hi>Indies,</hi> I muſt ſay it is a very Noble Gift, if he can make it good, and when he has convinced me that he can, I will thankfully accept it from him: but before he can give me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about it, I find ther muſt be a few words exchanged between us; and therefore, if he Pleaſes, I deſire him to tell me, how he came to be the Owner of ſo vaſt a Treaſure, which is, or lately was, in the poſſeſſion of ſo many Great and Potent Princes: And which way he will put me into
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60756:92"/>Poſſeſſion of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he cannot Anſwer theſe Queries (as I believe he cannot) I am ſure he can never conveigh the <hi>Indies</hi> to me; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for I will never trouble my Head more about them. And thus I fear it will fall out in the caſe of an Infallible Guide to all Chriſtians, who, were there ſuch a Church, or Perſon as they boaſt of at <hi>Rome,</hi> that could infallibly ſolve all Doubts, and put an end to all Controverſies in Religion, were richly worth both the <hi>Indies</hi> together. But before I accept of the Conduct of this Guide, I muſt deſire to be ſatisfied in a few things in reference to him. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How I may be certain that there is ſuch a Guide, or Judg of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies? For I find there is a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in the Church about it: And if I can never be aſſured that there is ſuch an one, till he has ended all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies (which is the great bleſſing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Promiſes from him) 'tis in vain in this Age of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies to enquire any farther after him. But ſuppoſe it were not; may I, or any other Proteſtant, determine this
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60756:92"/>Controverſy by the uſe of our own Fallible Judgments? If we may, then it ſeems a Fallible Judgment may do more ſometimes, than an Infallible Judg. However, a Fallible Judgment is all the Judgment that we have, and if by it we may be certain of an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Guide, which at <hi>Rome</hi> goes for a leading Article of Faith, I ſee no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we may not, by the ſame means be certain of all the Reſt; and if we may be ſo, it is plain there is no need of the Guide we are ſeeking for; and then I doubt, after all our ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſhall never be able to find him.</p>
               <p>But there is one Argument above all, that there is no ſuch Guide, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt never Promiſed, There ſhould be one always in his Church: And without a Promiſe from him, we can never be certain that there is. We know what is pretended in this matter, and what Texts are produce for it, but after the ſtricteſt, and moſt delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enquiry into the meaning of them, we can find no evidence of any ſuch Promiſe, nor diſcern the leaſt ſhadow or Footſtep of a viſible Infallible Guide.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:60756:93"/>
               <p>We own indeed that God has Promiſed the Guidance of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to all that deſire the Knowledg of his Ways, but we the rather think that he has not promiſed any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guide than this: For what need is there of the Inward Direction of the Spirit in the Search of Truth, when we have a Guide at hand that can lead us Infallibly into it, and ſave us the labour of ſearching after it? But did not our Saviour Promiſe to ſend his Spirit upon the Apoſtles, and were not they Infallible Guides? True, but did he Promiſe to make their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in all Ages Infallible too? If he did, every Succeſſor has an equal Claim: And then how comes the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to talk of but one Infallible Guidfe ſince the Death of the Apoſtles, and to Appropriate that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary favour to here ſelf? If he did not, ſhe muſt ſhew us a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Charter or Promiſe, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility ſhould never depart from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and when ſhe does that, we may allow her to be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. But ſuppoſing that Chriſt had
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60756:93"/>promiſed an Infallible Guide, it may be convenient to know,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether or no he has given him Authourity to ſuſpend the Judgment of all Chriſtians in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? This we muſt ſay is a diſtinct Power from Infallibility, unleſs we can imagin that our Saviour and his Apoſtles, tho they were infallible, did not know the extent of their Power: For 'tis plain they did not affect any ſuch Authority, or treat their Diſciples in this manner, but both required them to prove the Truths which they heard,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c.</note> and commended their Ingenuity in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them by the Scriptures. Beſides, a Guide whoſe Directions we muſt blindly follow, without examinig the Grounds and Tendency of them, ſeems to be a very improper means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to Heaven. For ſurely God did deſign, that in the exerciſe of our Religion we ſhould act like men; and not lay aſide our Reaſonand Judgment, as things that are dangerous to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 'Tis true, not to Judge at all, is a certain way not to err; but it is a very blind, and unlikely way to bring
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60756:94"/>men to the knowledge of the Truth, without which their Obedience can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a Reaſonable Service. And thereſore, if any Church, or Perſon, under colour of Infallibility, ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume an abſolute Authority over the Conſciences of men, before I reſign up my Judgment to them, I muſt deſire to be informed, not only how they come to be infallible, but what Commiſſion they have to oblige me to believe as they pleaſe, and to ſtrangle my own Senſe and Reaſon, if they offer to oppoſe any Doctrine of theirs, tho never ſo abſurd or contradictory to them.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe ſtill, there were Reaſons to convince me, that there is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge, and that there ought to be no Judge beſides him, yet becauſe he cannot be uſeful to me till I know who he is, there is another great Queſtion to be reſolved, before I can prudently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelf to him. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How I may certainly know where to find him? And here I meet with one vaſt Diſcouragement at the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into this enquiry: Namely, that the ſame Church, which alone pretends to this Infallible Guide, is very uncer
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60756:94"/>tain who he is. Some chain Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, and place it in the Perſon of the Pope: But this is the moſt Intereſſed Party, as depending en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon the Pleaſure of him whom they call Infallible. Others ſend us to General Councils; ſome of whcih have condemn'd the Pope for an Heretick, and contradicted the Decrees of former Councils. But then, what think we of Oral Tradition? Or the Doctrine of the Univerſal Churcvh conveighed by Father to Son, from the Apoſtles Time down to the Preſent Age? The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſent, I confeſs, of the Chriſtian Church, ſo far as it reaches, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means to find out the ſenſe of Scripture. But we are not ſpeaking now of Tradition, or the Church, as a Witneſs of Truth, but of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any Church or Guide to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a Rule of Faith and Practice by Vertue of an Inſallible Aſſiſtance. This is the thing we are enquiring after, and where the Seat of this Authority is; and all we can certainly learn hitherto is this, That ſeeing there are ſo many contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about it, it will be a very hard thing to find it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60756:95"/>there. And that in the Judgment of a conſiderable part of that Church, a man may tire himſelf, and be in queſt of his Infallible guide all his Days, and never come within ſight of him at laſt. For ſuppoſe he takes the Pope to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Oracle, he is thought to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken by all thoſe that ſtand for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral council; and if he go to a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral council, he is loſt in the opinion of all that declare for ſingle infallibility: And the men for Oral tradition think they are all deceived that look for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in any one Perſon, or Party in the Church. What muſt we do now, that have ſo much choice of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible guides, and nothing to determine our choice? Many we pick and chooſe at a venture? But that cannot be ſafe, becauſe they have occaſion ſometimes to lead contrary to one another, and therefore cannot be all infakubke: and none of them ſpeaks of more infallible guides than one. Muſt we then weigh their Reaſons, and the Scriptures they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for their ſeveral claims? Theſe we have often heard and conſidered, and cannot but admire the confidence of men, who pretend to ſound the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility and other Prerogatives of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60756:95"/>Biſhop and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon Texts that ſpeak not the leaſt Syllable of them: Whereas matters of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance ought to be expreſt in the eaſieſt and plainneſt Words, that he that runs may read them. If not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Peace and Unity of the Church, but every man's ſalvation depends (as our Adverſaries muſt ſay) upon the Right underſtanding of there Texts, we have that confidence in the Goodneſs of our Saviour, that we certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he would not expect we ſhould find out a meaning in therm, that by no good Rule of Interpretation can be collected from them. And for this Reaſon we cannot think our ſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, when any thing is ſaid in favour of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or of the Church in general, to underſtend it, and more than it implies (as theſe men would have us) of the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For why might not St. <hi>Peter</hi> be a Rock, and Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> (a <hi>Monothelite</hi>) and <hi>Liberius</hi> (the <hi>Arrian</hi>) no better than Waves? Muſt the Gates of Hell needs prevail againſt the Catholick Church, if the Biſhop of one Dioceſs prove not ſo Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60756:96"/>as he ſhould be? And why may not Chriſt be with his Church to the end of the World, tho he takes no greater care to preſerve it from Error than from ſinful Practice? And is it not modeſtly done of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to engroſs all the Promiſes to her ſelf, which are made to the Church U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal? And to argue all along (as ſhe does) upon the Ciedit of ths No tabel Principle, That a part is the whole, which bids Defiance to all the Reaſon of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Now ſince we cannot be ſure of our Guide, we muſt do as well as we can for our ſelves. Wemuſt Judge of things by ſuch Faculities as God hath given us; and if they are Fallible, was cannot help that, but find it to no purpoſe to judge at all, if we cannot be certain, either till we are Infallible, or till we can meet with an infallible Judge. But the beſt of it is, we may ſhift well enough without him, having an infallible Rule to walk by, plasn and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by thoſe that are duly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by it, in all the Neceſſary Points both of Faith and Practice. And for Doubtful caſes, as they require a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60756:96"/>Search, and the Aſſiſtance of better Judgments perhaps than our own; ſo God hath not left us deſtitute of theſe Advantages. He hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Men of Wiſdom and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be our Guide, and he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to aſſiſt both them and us in the Search of Truth; And if we will be directed by them in things whcih are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Level, we may ſatisfie our ſelves with this, that we take the beſt courſe we can to meke our Paths ſtreight, and to ſecure our progreſs tc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven. In a word, we may be ſure that God is always ready to bleſs the means of his own Appointment; and that if we deſire to approve our ſelves to him in the uſe of them, either he will not fuffer us to err, or he will not lay our Involuntary Errour to our charge.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to the third and laſt Obſervation, which is this:</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſ.</hi> That having found the ſtreight way to Heaven, we ought to be very careful and exact in walking in it, and not yeild to any Temptation to forſake it. The End of all the Advantages we
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60756:97"/>have of knowing the Will of God, is that we may readily apply our ſelves to the Practice of it: If we ſtop at tis, we certainly loſe all our Labour in enquiring after it. For 'tis impoſſible we ſhould reach to Heaven merely by knowing the ſtreight way, or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to walk in it, unleſs we hold on our courſe, and maintain it to the end. It is to be hoped, that we are all ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Religion, and that we know why we are ſo, having meaſured the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Doctrines and Inſtitutions of it by the Line of Scripture. And if we have done this with good Care and Judgment, let thoſe that take another Courſe be as Confident as they will, (there will be Confident Men to the end of the world we may be certain,) the while that we are upon the way to Eternal Life, nad hope by the Grace of God to perſevere in it. But then I cannot promiſe you that you ſhall meet with no Diſcouragements in this way: There is no Road upon Earth more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with Treacherous and Deceitful Men, that with great Civility will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to ſhew you a Readier and a finer way to Heaven, and tell you, if you
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60756:97"/>will but ſtep a little out of your way, to a Friend's houſe of theirs, they will bring you to an Infallible Man, that will ſave you many a weary ſtep, and prevent a multitude of Errors, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you will but be ſo civil, as to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him firſt to pull out your Eyes, which they ſay, only ſerve to miſlead you. But if you will be ſo unreaſon able as not to ſubmit to this, you muſt <hi>look to your ſelves:</hi> For tho the <hi>good men</hi> proſeſs a very deep compaſſion for the Blind and Ignorant; yet they don't think themſelves bound to keep Faith with Men that have their Eyes in their Heads.</p>
               <p>I wiſh we had no Occaſion to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Moral of this, But <hi>let not your hearts be troubled.</hi> You profeſs a Religion that can bear the Tryal, and has paſt the Ordeal already. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold <hi>faſt the profeſſion of your Faith, without wavering: Looking unto Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of it. Who for the joy that was ſet hefore him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and it ſet down at the Right Hand of the Throne of God. And be not like children, toſſed to and fro, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60756:98"/>carried about with every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, through the ſleight of men, and the cunning craftineſs of tboſe that lie in wait to deceive. Lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees; and make ſtreight pats for your feet, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligently leſt any man ſail of the Grace of God.</hi> The way to be ſtedfaſt in our Religion, is to be diligent in the practice of it. This will give it a grace in the Eyes of Men, and perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Adverſaries of it ſooner than the beſt Arguments we can urge them with. And this will ſecure us from ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Grace of God in our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Tryals and Exigencies, and from falling ſhort of the Glory which ſhall be hereafter revealed. I ſhall therefore enforce the Exhortation in the Text, as it reſers to our Practice, with theſe two Conſiderations, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the Honour and Intereſt of our holy Religion. I need not tell you how much the Proteſtant Religion ſtands upon its Reputation at this Day, and how watchful the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it are to improve all Advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages againſt it. I would to God, we would all ſeriouſly conſider this, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60756:98"/>not betray the Intereſts of the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the Wickedneſs and Impiety of our Lives. 'Tis our Happineſs to Live in the Communion of a Church which affords us all Advantages of knowing the direct and perfect way to Life and Salvation. We enjoy the juſt Freedom of our own Reaſon and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have as much Liberty as we can deſire, to conſult the Scriptures our ſelves. We may go to the Fountain Head, and try the Purity of any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that pretend to be derived from thence, even when they are brought down to us by a whole ſtream of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters. So that it is to be ſuppoſed, that our Religio hath approv'd it ſelf to our Judgments; and that we call it ours, not becauſe it was the Religion of our Fathers, or had the good turn to be the Eſtabliſht Religion of the Nation; but becauſe we have through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tryed and examined the Grounds of it: becauſe we have proved it by a Rule which cannot fail us, and do find it to be the very Religion which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have revealed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Now if we have taken up our Religion upon due confidweration, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60756:99"/>Judgment, it very highly concerns us, for the ſake of it, to live according to its excellent Rules and Precepts, and to be as ſteddy in our walk, as we pretend to be ſure of our way to Heaven. If we go wide from the Paths we have made ſtreight, and do not Obey the Doctrine we profeſs to believe upon clear and convincing Evidence, we condemn our ſelves, and give juſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Adverſary to triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, and to twiſt us with the great need we had <hi>of a Reformation,</hi> to make us <hi>worſe</hi> than we need to have been without it: We put a <hi>ſharper Weapon into their hands,</hi> than any they were ever able <hi>to forge</hi> againſt it. A Witty Men may make a hard ſhift to ſay <hi>ſomething for Romiſh Errors,</hi> but there is not <hi>a word to be ſpoken for an Antichristian Life.</hi> With what face can we inveigh againſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> Indulgences; while we <hi>allow our ſelves</hi> as great a liberty in ſinning as they do? If we are heedleſs, and <hi>undevout in our Prayers,</hi> we may bluſh to ſay, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſpence with <hi>Latin</hi> Service, becauſe it is an hinderance <hi>to Devotion.</hi> And is it not much at one, whether he that in the holy Sacrament, eateth or drinketh
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60756:99"/>Judgment to himſelf, does it in both Kinds, or but One? Or what ſigniſies a change, or no change in the ſubſtance of the Elements, to him that diſcerns not the Lords Body? Or why may not an Implicit Faith, ſerve to make an Empty Profeſſion, as well as any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Faith in the World? And indeed, if that were all we deſign by being Proteſtants, it were hardly worth the while to be ſo; For as <hi>without Faith it is Impoſſible to Pleaſe God, So without Holineſs</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells us in the verſe immediately after the Text) <hi>No man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We that are Proteſtants, profeſs a great Veneration of the Scriptures, both as a Rule of Faith, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: And therefore we can never excuſe our ſelves, if we do not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our Lives, as well as our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Opinions by them: And there are thoſe that will not excuſe our Religion, but raiſe Objections againſt it out of thoſe very Actions it expreſly Condemns, and Warns us of the Infinite Danger of. It is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, very unreaſonable, that Religion ſhould Anſwer for the Faults which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60756:100"/>it Aimes to Rectify: Yet it muſt be Own'd a Real and Mighty Prejudice to it, to be Contradicted by its own Profeſſors, and Betrayed by thoſe that pretend a Hearty Zeal and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it.</p>
               <p>And we have the more Reaſon to be Cautious on this hand, becauſe our Religion is ſo Excellent in it ſelf, and ſo fully Juſtified by its Learned Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates, that it requires nothing more for its Defence and Vindication from tis, than that we ſhould Adorn it by our Holy Converſations, and keep the Enemy out of thoſe Breaches which our Diviſions have made, and our Luſts have Widen'd for them. And this is our Proper Poſt: In which we may do Excellent ſervice (tho we may not be ſo fit to engage in the Field of Controverſies) merely by Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing our ſelves unto Godlineſs, by keeping to the Plain Rules, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Principles of our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This, I ſay, is our Proper Task: And by this means we ſhall utterly Defeat our Adverſaries, and put them to the ſame ſtrait that <hi>Daniel</hi> did the <hi>Caldeans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.5.</note> by leaving
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60756:100"/>them no Occaſion againſt us, <hi>Except it be Concerning the Law of our God.</hi> And for that we give them leave to Try their utmoſt skill: And if by fair Reaſoning and Arguments (ſuch as are fit to be uſed in the great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mens Eternal Salvation) they can Win the Victory, let them wear it.</p>
               <p>I wiſh, the mean while, we could clear our ſelves as well as we can our Religion. I wiſh we could all ſhew, out of a Pure Converſation, that our Lives are meaſured by the Laws, as our Faith is by the Revelations of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. I do not ſpeak this, as if I thought our Adverſaries had the advantage of us in this reſpect: but becauſe it may be Juſtly expected, that we, who have the beſt Religion, ſhould live at the beſt Rate; That we who pretend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what we believe, and to <hi>know whom we Worſhip,</hi> and have Renounc't the Errours and Corruptions that ſpoil the Religion of other men, ſhould be extreamly careful that we do not Blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh our own: That we do not ſtain the Purity of our Profeſſion, and Furniſh Men with Objections againſt it, by our vain and vicious Converſations.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60756:101"/>
               <p>Let us conſider the Neceſſity of walking by the Rules, and obeying the Laws of our Religion, in order to our own ſafety and Happineſs. Tho a Man knew every Foot of his Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and were Acquainted with all the Crooked and Deceitful Paths, which others are loſt and Bewildred in, yet if he will not make uſe of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Direct his Steps, and keep on in the way he ſhould go, he can never arrive to that Bleſſed Place. We muſt not think to Fly to Heaven with a Wiſh, or to be ſaved by being <hi>Orthodox,</hi> or excuſed from doing our Duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know it. Tho we had all knowledge, and all Faith, without Obedience and Holineſs of Life, I know not of what importance they would be to us, but only to Intitle us to the greater Damnation. The Sanctions of the Goſpel are the ſame to Men of all Perſuaſions: The worſt of which will hardly Deny, that a good Life is as Neceſſary to make a good Chriſtian, as a ſound and <hi>Orthodox Faith.</hi> So that 'tis not Believing as the Church Believes, nor Believing the Truth as it is in Jeſus, nor Relying upon him for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60756:101"/>that can bring us to Heaven, while we bid Defiance to his Laws:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.</note> For he is <hi>the Author of Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them</hi> only <hi>that Obey him.</hi> If we are ill Men, it matters not what we are beſides. Any Religion will ſerve a wicked Man as well as the Beſt: And become him a great deal better than the Pure and Undefiled Religion, which the Son of God brought down from Heaven with him; And which, of all Religions in the World, Denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the moſt Terrible Threatnings againſt its own Profeſſors, that Reject the Mild and Reaſonable Conditions of it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7.8.</note> 
                  <hi>To them that by patient Continuance in Well-doing, Seek for Glory, and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and Immortality,</hi> It promiſes <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. But unto them that Obey not the Truth</hi> (how Zealous ſoever they may be in the Defence and Profeſſion of it) It denounceth <hi>Indignation and wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh, without Reſpect of Perſons, upon every Soul of Man that doth Evil.</hi> So that, if we live and dye in our Sins, 'tis not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial what Church we Live, or Dye in Communion with. While we are in Bondage to our Luſts, all the Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60756:102"/>in the World can do us no Good. If we ſtudy to ſerve and Pleaſe God, we need not any Indulgencies from Men: And if we do not, we ſhall be never the better for them.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs ſay (after all that has been ſaid on both ſides) I cannot ſee the leaſt Reaſon we have to Change our Religion: To leave the <hi>ſtreight Path</hi> we are in, and to go about by the Saints to our Redeemer, and by Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to Heaven; to leave the Holy Scriptures which were written for our Inſtruction, and to Turn to <hi>Legends</hi> and ſtories of Saints, which a ſerious Man would think were compoſed only for Merriment and Diverſion. But tho we have no Reaſon at all to Change our Religion, yet ſurely there is great Reaſon for many of us to make Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable alterations in our Lives, to change almoſt the whole Frame and Tenour of them, and to reform our ſelves, who call our ſelves <hi>the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not only for the Credit of our Profeſſion, that our Lives be uniform to it, but our Immortal Honour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt depend upon it. We loſe the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60756:102"/>Crown of Life, if we faint in the Race that is ſet before us; and there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to eſcape everlaſting Death, than to perſiſt in the way that leadeth to Life Eternal. If a man ſhould tempt you to renounce your Faith, I verily hope the Danger of it to your eternal Salvation, would hinder you from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to him: But then there is the ſame Danger in a Prophane and Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life; and therefore the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to forſake every evil way, to deny every ſinful Appetite and Worldly Luſt, to be cautious of our ſteps, and having found the Way of Truth, to keep a ſtreight and even Courſe to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. Is it not an Article of our Faith, that no <hi>unrighteous man ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God?</hi> And ſhall we live in a perpetual Jar and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to our ſelves? To conclude, we had as good pin our Faith upon the ſleeves of other men, or beſtow it upon any body that will take it off our hands, as keep it only to riſe up in Judgment againſt us.</p>

               <p>'TIS hard to name any of the great Rules of Chriſtian Piety, without reflecting upon the ſenſible Decays of it in the preſent Age; an Age much addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to talk and wrangle about Religion, very ſtout and zealous in oppoſing and maintaining the Doctrines which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Chriſtian World; but very cold and careleſs in the neceſſary points of Practice; without which the beſt Religion degenerates into Two of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60756:103"/>worſt things in the World, Hypocriſie and Superſtition. This being our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, it concerns us to look well to our ſelves, and <hi>ſeeing we know theſe things before,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks immediately before the Text) to <hi>beware, leſt we alſo, being led away by the Error of the Wicked</hi> [the bad Opinions and ill Examples of men] <hi>fall from our own ſtedfaſtneſs.</hi> To which he adds this Excellent Advice, as a certain Rule to prevent the Danger of ſo fatal an Apoſtacy. <hi>But grow in Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grace</hi> is a Term of Various Senſes and Acceptations in Scripture, being frequently taken for Favour and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God or Men, for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, whereby we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to perform the Will of God, and for thoſe Good Diſpoſitions and Habits of the Mind, which are the Genuine Effects and Product of it. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe, it is the ſame thing with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Holineſs, and is moſt properly ſo to be underſtood, whenever, as in the Text, it is the Matter, or Subject of an Exhortation.</p>
               <p>Now in this Exhortation, to <hi>grow in Grace,</hi> theſe two things are plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:60756:104"/>
               <p n="1">1. A Root or Principle of Holineſs, actually implanted in us. We muſt be in a ſtate of Grace before we can make any progreſs or proficiency in it. There muſt be a ſtock before there can be an increaſe, a quickneſs in the Root before the Branches will ſprout or flouriſh, a ſpringing of Grace and Vertue before an <hi>abounding in the fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And this ſhews to whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Exhortation belongs, namely, to men that are in a ſtate of Holineſs, and have not received the Grace of God in <hi>vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is here implied, That Good Men are nor meerly paſſive in growing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but may and muſt do ſomething towards it themſelves. Nay, the Text ſuppoſes they muſt do enough to make it their own Act; and that the Work of Sanctification muſt ceaſe, if they refuſe their Endeavours to farther and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it. Did the beſt we can do, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing to the making us better, there would be no room for our Endeavours; and conſequently no Reaſon for all the Counſels, Admonitions and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel to uſe them. The Spirit of God is indeed the Author and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60756:104"/>Fountain of all Grace; But then he has appointed the uſe of Means both in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Birth and Growth of it. He knows therefore, that by his Aſſiſtance, which he is always ready to afford us, we may attain to ſuch a Growth and Perfection in Grace, as is requiſite to qualifie us for the higheſt Degrees of Glory and Happineſs. And by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it is that we ſhould be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved and excited to uſe the means he hath preſcribed for our improvement in Grace and Piety. And this is a plain Argument, that our Endeavours are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful to this End; and that as weak and imperfect as they are, our profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in all Virtue and Goodneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon them.</p>
               <p>Now to make this Exhortation as uſeful and effectual as I can, I ſhall aim at theſe four things.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. To explain the Nature of our Spiritual Growth. The work of Grace is neither begun nor carried on by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles, without the mighty Aids and Operations of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, who Inables us <hi>both to will, and to do, of his good Pleaſure.</hi> Nor does a Chriſtian grow like a Plant, merely by the Influences of Heaven: But by improving the aſſiſtances he Receives from thence, and uſing the means preſcribed to him for obtaining new Meaſures of Grace and Holineſs. And hence we may diſcover both the Principles of our growth in Grace, and the manner of our growing in it. The firſt mover in it is the good Spirit of God, the giver of <hi>every goods and perfect gift:</hi> And ſubordinate to it, is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or mind of Man, diſpoſed in ſome degree to grow in Grace by the Grace he hath already obtain'd, and excited to greater meaſures by the Spirit of Holineſs, through the uſe of thoſe means, which he hath appointed for the increaſe of Holineſs in us.</p>

               <p>That there are degrees of Grace in good men, no man ever denied: And that the higher and more Perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are attained by a more frequent, ſincere, and diligent uſe of the means of Grace, all Divines are agreed. The part therefore which every good Man hath in his Spiritual growth, is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all Advantages for his growing better, <hi>i.e.</hi> more perfect in every Grace, and more <hi>Holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> And becauſe ſome Graces have a more Powerful and Diffuſive influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, upon the Sanctification of our Hearts and Lives, and the due Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all Chriſtian duties, than others, our improvement in Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs chiefly conſiſts in theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In a more conſtant and vigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of thoſe Radical Graces, by which the Life of Holineſs is conveighed into all the Branches and Inſtances of it. Of theſe our Faith in God is the main and Principal Root, all other Graces being Fed and Cheriſht by it, and Inabled to bring forth their Proper Fruits. The Reaſon why we Love God, which is both the Nobleſt and the ſtrongeſt Motive to Obedience, is becauſe we
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60756:106"/>believe that he has all Excellent and Amiable Properties in him. And ſo the Reaſon why we Fear him, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we believe he is Powerful and Juſt, and will by no means clear the Guilty. And we therefore Hope in his Mercy becauſe we believe <hi>He is Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that hath Promiſed.</hi> And as Faith is the Root and Principle of theſe Graces, ſo have they a Radical virtue of their own; a Power, I mean of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing Holineſs into all parts and duties of the Chriſtirn Life. Hence we are exhorted to <hi>Perfect Holineſs in the Fear of God;</hi> and to be <hi>Rooted and Grounded in Love, that we may be filled with all the Fulneſs of God;</hi> And <hi>every man</hi> (ſaith S. John) <hi>that hath the Hope in him</hi> of ſeeing God as he is, <hi>Purifieth himſelf, even as he is Pure.</hi> To grow therefore in theſe Graces, is in effect to grow in all other kinds of Vertue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. And then ſecondly, our ſpiritual growth Conſiſts,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In being more frequently and carneſtly employ'd in the ſeveral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſtian practice; In worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God with more Life, Zeal, and Conſtancy: In doing good with more
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60756:106"/>vigour, and chearfulneſs: In bearing Afflictions with more evenneſs and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: In greater Induſtry, Juſtice, and Faithfulneſs in our Temporal callings: In getting a more abſolute ſway over our Paſſions, and reducing our affections to Farthly things to a more equal and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Temper: In denying our ſelves the Liberties (which have any apparent Temptation in them; in Arming our ſelves againſt the inſults of Inordinate anger, and the ſudden ſtarts of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inclinations; In pruning off the undecencies of our External behaviour, in abating the freedom of our Tongues, and uſing better care to avoid all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Evil. Herein lies our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Grace and Virtue, to which our endeavours in all theſe inſtances are ſtrictly neceſſary, if we aim, as we ought, at a Perfect Imitation of our great example, and to grow up to <hi>the ſtature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> I am next to ſhew,</p>
               <p n="2">2. What are the Proper and Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means of our Growth in Grace. And here, ſince the nature of Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs conſiſts in a Conformity to the Divine nature and will, it is Reaſonable
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60756:107"/>to ſuppoſe, that the ſame hand that drew the firſt Lineaments of it, muſt give it the more Lively and Finiſhing ſtrokes, before it comes to perfection; I mean, that the work of grace ſhould be carried on by the Operations of the Spirit, through the uſe (eſpecially) of the ſame means, by which we were <hi>made Partakers of the Divine Nature</hi> at firſt. And for this Reaſon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God are of Perpetual uſe to all Chriſtians, and the ſame duties required, as well of the Regenerate, as of thoſe that remain in a Natural State.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A better underſtanding of the will of God, and Attention to the Truths revealed by his Son Jeſus Chriſt. The uſefulneſs of this means S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to Recommend in the Context: <hi>Grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a greater meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a ſpecial means of growing in other Graces; as is plain by that Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel exhortation in his former Epiſtle, <hi>Deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel, or the word delivered without
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60756:107"/>any Deceit, is the moſt Natural Food for the New Creature, for promoting the Growth of it, and making it every way ſtrong and vigorous in the <hi>Grace which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the Scriptures we have a lively Draught and Repreſentation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections. In them we behold all the Glorious Revelations of God's Sacred Will to Mankind, and the thoughts of his Heart from Eternity. Here we meet with the kindeſt Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Mercy and Favour of God, and the Merits of a Saviour: With the moſt admirable Rules for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lives, the moſt Excellent Patterns of the Nobleſt Virtues, and the ſtrongeſt Inducements to a perfect Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them. The Myſtery of our Redemption is here unvail'd, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as it were, thrown open to our view, that <hi>we</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>with Open Face beholding, as in a Glaſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>the Glory of the Lord, might be changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By frequent converſing with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and obſerving the Tenour of them, we ſhall not only attain to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60756:108"/>Knowledge of our Duty, but to a firm and Ruling Judgment; and be thereby exempted from Error and Doubtfulneſs, which are none of the leaſt impediments to our thriving in Grace and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>By this means we ſhall be continually under the power of conviction: The ſenſe of our Duty will be always quick and urgent upon our Minds: We ſhall feel the great Motives and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Goſpel, the Eternal Weights of Glory and Miſery, preſſing upon our Hopes and Fears, and provoking us to every Good Work; and we ſhall thence be furniſht with a preſent Anſwer to all Temptations to gratifie any ſinful Luſt, or neglect the Opportunities of ſecuring our Future Happineſs. So that by making the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture our daily Study and Meditation, we ſhall neither wander for want of Light, nor be at a ſtand through any miſtruſt of our way; nor can we eaſily fail of making a good Progreſs in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickned upon all occaſions with a preſent ſenſe of our Duty, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with a Proſpect of our Reward.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:60756:108"/>
               <p n="2">2. Regular and Conſtant Attendance on the Publick Ordinances of Divine Worſhip and Service. It muſt be a great advantage to us to be admitted into the Special Preſence of God in the Holy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of his People; And having our thoughts ſequeſtred from the World, and our Hearts warmed with Fervent and Divine Affections, to converſe entirely with him, who is the Foundation of all Wiſdom and Grace: To have free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to his Infinite Treaſures of Mercy and Goodneſs, a freedom to ask all that we want, and a promiſe to receive all that we ask; to be employed in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Praiſes of God, the Great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven, and one of the Chief Delights of Eternity: To hear his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles expounded, the Myſteries of our Religion unfolded, the Precepts of it explained, the Motives to it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd, the ſins againſt it detected and removed, and the concernment of all digeſted into Plain Leſſons and Rules of Practice. How juſtly may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſweet Illapſes and cheriſhing Influences of the Divine Spirit, when we meet together for theſe bleſſed ends, and are engaged in theſe holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes?
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60756:109"/>Eſpecially, when to theſe we add the frequent Receiving of the Lord's Supper; and Inſtitution peculiarly adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Coufirmation and Improvement of all Chriſtian Graces. In this Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we have the Tendereſt and moſt Engaging Repreſentation of Infinite Obligations, which our Bleſſed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er laid upon us, to mortifie our ſins which Crucified him, to tread in the ſteps of his moſt Holy Life, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his <hi>Peculiar People,</hi> being <hi>zealous of Good Works.</hi> Beſides, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Federal Rite, in which we ſolemnly renew our former Vows, and oblige our ſelves by the ſacred Pledges of Chriſt's Body and Blood, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what he has required of us, as well as what He has done and ſuffered for us: To give up our ſelves entirely to his Service, and to perform the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant we entred into, when we were Baptized into his Name. And what can be of Greater force to bind us to the Obedience of our Bleſſed Lord, than ſuch a ſolemn Vow and Profeſſion as this? If the Holy Bands of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will not hold us, 'tis to be feared that nothing will ever do it. Now if
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60756:109"/>we frequently engage in theſe Duties, and exerciſe the Graces that are proper to them, this in a ſhort time will turn to a mighty account; every good Act will ſtrengthen the Habit, and invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Principle it flows from: And we ſhall certainly experience the Truth of that Promiſe, Pſal. 92.13, 14. <hi>Thoſe that are Planted in the Houſe of the Lord, ſhall Flouriſh in the Courts of our God; They ſhall ſtill bring forth Fruit in Old Age; they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Private Devotion is another help to the Growth of Grace and Piety. Our Hearts are of that Temper, in the Beſt Frame that ever they were in, ſo ſuddenly cool'd, and ſo apt to return to their Natural Hardneſs, that we can never thrive long in our Spiritual Eſtate, without the conſtant Influences of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace. And ſince theſe depend upon our frequent and fervent Prayers, and the Intervals of publick Prayer are generally much longer than thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Temptations, it concerns us the mean while to recruit our ſelves by our private and ſerious Applications to the Throne of Grace, to which weare encouraged by very Gracious and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60756:110"/>Promiſes. And that we may do this to the beſt advantage, we ſhall do well to obſerve certain and ſtated Times of Retiring to our Cloſets, and Praying to <hi>Our Father in Secret:</hi> And when we meet with any Interruptions, to make them up as well as we can, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by falling into ſome Pious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or by ſhort Petitions and Praiſes, which the Buſieſt Hour of our Lives can hardly, unleſs we will, deprive us of the benefit of.</p>
               <p>The Advantages of this courſe are not eaſie to be enumerated. The breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our Souls to God in holy Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Supplications, when there is no Eye or Ear but his to regard us, is one of the greateſt Tokens of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity towards him: And that is the greateſt aſſurance we can have that our Prayers will be heard, and that we ſhall not want Grace to help us in time of need. Beſides, it raiſes our minds into a Heavenly Frame: It keeps up a lively ſenſe of God in our Hearts: It diſpoſeth us to do him more chearful and faithful Service: It enlarges our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and widens our Souls, and fits us for fuller communications of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60756:110"/>and Goodneſs: In a word, it che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes all the great Principles of Virtue and Piety in us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To accuſtom our ſelves to conſider that God's Eye is continually upon us. The Reverence every good man has for the Great and Glorious God, when it is awakened with an actual appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his Inſpection over him, muſt have a mighty power over his Spirit, and effectually excite him to do every thing in the manner he knows to be moſt acceptable to him. We ſee the force of this Incentive, in ſome meaſure, in the influence which a Fathers Eye, or the preſence of a Great Man has upon the Virtue and Behaviour of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Inferiours. The ſight of ſuch a Witneſs of their Actions commands their Reverence, and inflames their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to demean themſelves ſutably to the regard they owe to the Preſence they are in. Much more, were our Minds poſſeſt with a Lively Sence of God's All-diſcovering Eye, that He is whereſoever we are, and obſerves what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we do, ſhould we find our ſelves moved to do the beſt that we can to pleaſe him; and this deſire would
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60756:111"/>quicken our endeavours, and our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would improve our graces. The Objects of Faith are much greater than the Objects of Sence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lively Apprehenſion of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Object, and eſpecially of Him, in whom we are infinitely more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned than in all Heaven and Earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, muſt needs be more Powerful than the cleareſt ſenſible Perception. And this is apparently the Ground of that Rule of Perfection which God gave to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>Walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and be thou perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Due enquiry into the Nature and Conſequence of things, and eſpecially of thoſe Actions which are like to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the main Courſe of our Lives, before we actually engage in them. The want of this care has occaſion'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſerious and hopeful Perſons to run themſelves into a ſtate of Temptation, which in ſpight of their Future Caution, has proved a mighty Clog and Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to their Progreſs in Virtue and Goodneſs, perhaps ever after. On the other hand, a timely inſpection into any ſtate of Life which falls under our choice, might prevent a thouſand Snares,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60756:111"/>into which we often betray our ſelves by our Raſhneſs and Folly. We ſee many caſt away at their firſt Launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into the World, meerly by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying more Sail than Ballaſt. Nor is any thing more viſible, than that Right Judgment at the firſt in chooſing our Callings, and contracting our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Alliances, conduces very much to ſecure our Virtue and make our Proficiency in it by many degrees more eaſie and conſiderable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It will likewiſe contribute to our Improvement in Grace, to take a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent view of our Spiritual Eſtate. By obſerving and bewailing our Defects and Failings, we ſhall be ſtrongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to amend them. And this will make us more humble, more ſenſible of our Dependence upon god, and more importunate with him for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure of his Spirit, to preſerve us from the like Miſcarriages for the future. This will ſend us to his Mercy-ſeat, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſhame and ſorrow, for the pardon of our ſins: And the bitterneſs of them will call to mind the Pleaſure and ſatisfaction we formerly enjoyed in the ſenſe of his Favour, through the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60756:112"/>Faithful Diſcharge of our Duty to him. And this will fire our Hearts with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indignation againſt our ſelves, for the diſhonour we have done to God and our Redeemer, the waſte we have made of our Inward Peace, and the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we have loſt of doing Great and Glorious Things for our ſelves, of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing our Peace with God, and inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Election to Eternal Life. All which do naturally tend to provoke us to the greateſt care to approve our ſelves to God for the time to come, which is a ſteady and Univerſal Principle of true Virtue and Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, Serious and Frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation upon the Joys and Glories of the Heavenly State, will ſurely caſt our Minds into a more Spiritual Frame, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our Converſations, and Improve our Graces. 'Tis true, an exact Idea of Heaven is not to be attained at this diſtance from it: But did we often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what we have read and believe of that Glorious Place, we ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feel our ſelves inſpired with Nobler Thoughts, and Brisker Reſolutions in relation to it; we ſhould not ſanter up and down after earthly Vanities, nor
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60756:112"/>give way to every Petty Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Mean Temptation, and ſo make our Journey more heavy and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious than we need, as if we were afraid of coming too ſoon to our Happineſs. The Glories which are above, were we better acquainted with them, would darken all theſe inferiour Beauties which captivate our Souls, the ſmile of Pleaſures, the ſhine of Riches, and the luſtre of Honours. Did we ſix our minds where true Joys and Felicities are to be found, the gloſs of worldly excellencies would vaniſh and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as leſſer Lights loſe their Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the appearance of the Greater. There would be little danger of Loiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Way, or falling ſhort of the end of our Hope, if we would but keep our Eye upon thoſe Happy Regions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and conſider what Mighty Joys are there, what Maſſie Crowns are laid up for the Lovers of God and Goodneſs. We ſhould be all Life and Spirit, even in thoſe very Duties which now go off ſo heavily with us; we ſhould cut through all Difficulties, and ſoar above all Temptations from this lower World, if the other was always in our view,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60756:113"/>and our Hearts were filled with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it. This would raiſe our Spirits, and elevate our Souls, till we ſhould even touch and feel the Pleaſures of the Heavenly State. And indeed the only way for thoſe that are in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſtate of Grace, to recover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a healthful and thriving temper, is to ſtrengthen their Appetite to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, by livelier apprehenſions of the Glory and Reality of them. By this they will quickly come to loath the Husks and Traſh of this World, and retrieve the ſtrength and vigour they have loſt by their eagerneſs after them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing propounded, was to warn you of the great Hinderances and Obſtructions to your Spiritual Growth. 'Tis evident, that Remiſneſs in any of the former Duties will defeat the Deſign and Efficacy of them: And therefore every Neglect and Error in the uſe of thoſe Means is to be carefully avoided, as an obſtruction to the end of Growing better. Beſides which I ſhall briefly remind you of theſe three Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Falſe and miſtaken Notions in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. Some think they were
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60756:113"/>Reprobated from Eternity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never were in a State of Grace, and then to what purpoſe ſhould they think of Growing in it? Others, that they cannot fall from Grace, becauſe they were abſolutely Elected: And the ſame Perſons are commonly of Opinion, that every degree of Grace is wrought in them by the immediate Operation of the Spirit, tho they freely acknowledge the uſe of Means. This, I confeſs, is a very Ingenuous acknowledgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is undoubtedly true that they ought to uſe Means, and it is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt themſelves, when they ſpeak againſt the immediate workings of the Spirit. But I the rather think that their Opinions are not true, becauſe they manifeſtly tend to check and ſtifle their endeavours after Grace and Holineſs, tho I verily believe they have not this effect upon ſome very ſerious Perſons, through their Happy Ignorance of the conſequences of them. If we are ſure that we are abſolutely elected to Eternal Life,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.</note> I cannot ſee why we ſhould <hi>work out our Salvation</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us) <hi>with fear and Trembling,</hi> becauſe there can be no Fear that an Abſolute
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60756:114"/>Decree ſhould fail. And then to what purpoſe is it to make uſe of means, if the Operations of the Spirit do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately produce their Effects? For if they do ſo, there would be no room left for the uſe of Means, unleſs there can be an immediate Cauſe that works its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by Means, <hi>i. e.</hi> that does not work it immediately. And what is this, but to render all the Means of Increaſing Holineſs in us, utterly vain and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Want of Vigilancy over the Faults and Weakneſſes of our Natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. When men firſt turn their Thoughts to Religion, and their Eyes inwards, they are deeply ſenſible of their more hainous and provoking ſins, and extreamly cautious of any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to them, but are ſeldom very watchful over the leſſer Faults and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which are deeply rooted in their Conſtitutions, and grow up from their Infancy with them. Theſe they are very apt to overlook and indulge (as if they had a Right of Protection from them) till they ſuffer them to ſhade and overtop their Graces. There is no man of ſo clear a Diſpoſition, but he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60756:114"/>has ſome Flaws and Infirmities with his Excellent Temper: And ſome Natures are ſo very bad, that without a mighty care to manage and improve them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good will ever come to any Ripeneſs or Perfection in them. And if it be rightly conſidered, the want of this care is the manifeſt reaſon of the miſcarriage of Men, otherwiſe Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Good, who are often tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Great Diſorders and Indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by an unguarded Humour, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diſpoſition, which they brought into the World with them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out long care and watchſulneſs, is like to ſend them halting to their Graves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Spiritual Pride: I mean, Pride of Underſtanding in matters of Religion, and an over weening conceit of more than ordinary Attainments in Holineſs. This alone is enough to blaſt the moſt hopeful beginnings in Virtue and Piety. This is Root of every new Sect, which brings forth the Bitter Fruits of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, Schiſm, Error, Envy and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: And (I was going to ſay) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever obſtructs the Power of godlineſs, and the Flouriſhing of Chriſtianity in the World. In ſhort, there is nothing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60756:115"/>more directly contrary to the Spirit of the Goſpel, than Spiritual Pride, and particularly to that humble and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Frame of Spirit, which is eſſential to the Diſciples of the Meek and Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus, and indiſpenſably Neceſſary to the improvement of all Divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Qualities in them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now endeavour in the laſt place,</p>
               <p n="4">4. To inforce the Apoſtles Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſhewing what weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Obligations we have to be growing in Grace. it is, you ſee, as plain a Duty as any the Goſpel Urges, and it is a very large and comprehenſive one: But our encouragement is, the Spirit of God is always ready to aſſiſt us, and to carry our endeavours ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully through it; and therefore the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of it can be no reaſonable exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption againſt it: Eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a State of Perfection, which the Practice of this Duty natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally leads us to. It is the very greateſt Condition, the higheſt and nobleſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment we can poſſibly aſpire after. Holineſs is the Glory of our Nature,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60756:115"/>and the Crown of all Humane and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Perfections; ſo that every time we attain to a new degree of Grace, we acquire a new degree of Honour and Excellency. The Righteous (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>is more Excellent, than his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 12.26</note> And the more Righteous he is, the more he advances in real Worth and Dignity above him. The Glory of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, the Enlargement of Empire, and the Affectation of deep &amp; curious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are but Childiſh and Mean things, in Compariſon of a Godlike Temper and Diſpoſition, which is the natural Fruit of Growing in Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Since therefore the Perfection of our Nature lies in living up to the Rules of Chriſtianity, and Exerciſing the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces of it, and there is Room for Improvement in the beſt of us, we ſhould greatly neglect our ſelves, and ſtand in our own Light, if we ſhould not continually aime to Grow better than we are, and to Perfect Holineſs in the Fear of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The certain knowledge of our Good Eſtate towards God, Depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Proficiency in Grace and Virtue. We cannot argue ſtrongly from the Firſt Eſſays of Goodneſs, while our
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60756:116"/>Graces are Weak, our good Reſolutions untryed, or our Relapſes Frequent. And while we ſlaken our Diligence, we ſhall be continually Hovering between Hopes and Fears, and never come to a clear and ſettled underſtanding of our ſpiritual condition, But now, no Man doubts of his ſincerity towards God, while he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Pleaſe him, and is careful to avoid every thing that is Offenſive and Diſhonourable to him. His mind never troubles him while he is well employ'd, (unleſs it be firſt Clouded with Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which (as one well obſerves) is not a Reaſonable caſe) but when he grows Remiſs in his known Duty, or is Conſcious to himſelf of ſome wilful Sin, or Deviation from the way of Righteouſneſs; And the onely way to be eaſed of this trouble, and to be well aſſured of his Integrity for the future, is to return into the Paths of Virtue and Religion, and proceed Vigorouſly in them. The more we Grow in Grace, the more evident will our Good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be; The farther we Pierce into the ways of Holineſs, the more plainly it will appear (to our unſpeakable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction) that we are no longer in a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60756:116"/>State of Sin and Death; and that by the Grace of God we are <hi>Delivered from the Power of Darkneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.13. Prov. 4.18</note> 
                  <hi>and Tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of his Dear Son. The Path of the Juſt is as the Shining Light, which Shineth more and more unto the Perfect Day.</hi> As the Sun ſhines the Brighter, the Higher he Riſes in the Heavens, ſo the Light of the Righteous, his Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Joy and Comfort, Increaſes in the ſame Degrees, by which he Advanceth to the Heavenly State.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us Conſider, that our minds are of that Quick and Active Temper, that if we do not Grow better, we ſhall be in Conſtant danger of declining in our Spiritual Eſtate, and Growing worſe. Something we muſt be doing, to quiet our Reſtleſs Deſires and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And if we don't ſeriouſly mind the Buſineſs of Religion, the Tempter and our own Hearts will find us other Imployments: And the World will In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagle us with Gayer Promiſes, and more Charming Invitations, than any the Goſpel has, to Gratify our Senſual Inclinations with. If we once make a ſtop in our Chriſtian Courſe, we give our Cunning Adverſary the Devil, a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60756:117"/>fair opportunity to Practiſe his Wiles and Deluſions upon us. he knows the Activity of our Minds: He obſerves which way our Thoughts rove, and our Affections Wander: What Duties are moſt Tireſome to us, and what Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we moſt Hanker after: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will be ſure to lay his Trains, and manage his Temptations to the beſt Advantage: And having found the weak ſide of our nature, to aſſault us where he is moſt likely to do the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Execution upon us. It therefore mightily Concerns us, having begun Proſperouſly, to keep on the Growing hand; And not loſe the Ground we have gain'd, and the Conqueſts we have made over our Luſts and Vices, by ſtanding ſtill (while we ſee them Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before us) with our hands in our ſleeves, till the Enemy renew the War, and we are Driven back from all our Good Reſolutions, and are Forc't to Retire with Shame and Anguiſh, to Review the Wounds we Received in our Diſhonourable Retreat from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may next Conſider, that God is pleas'd to lengthen out the day of Grace
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60756:117"/>(unleſs we ſhorten it our ſelves) to the End of our Lives, that we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies Growing to greater Perſection in it. 'Tis our own Fault, if ever he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the Aſſiſtance of his Spirit from us, and makes our Day of Grace ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Days of our Lives. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our incurable Barrenneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Means of Grace, can provoke him to ſo high an Act of Juſtice and Severity: But that this will do it, his Declaring upon Oath that the Revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ifraelites ſhould not enter into his Reſt, and our Saviours Curſing the Fig-tree that brought forth nothing but Leaves <hi>[let no Fruit grow on thee hence forward for ever]</hi> are very Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Intimations. This Conſideration therefore ſhould excite us to <hi>abound in all the Fruits ef Righteouſneſs,</hi>

                  <hi>which are by Jeſus Cnriſt to the Praiſe and Glory of God,</hi> Who is pleaſed to wait for our Improvement, and to furniſh us with all the Means and Abilities which are requiſite to it: And is ſo gracious as not to Exact at once the whole ſumm in which we are Indebted to him, but accepts our obedience in ſuch Small Parcels, and poor Degrees, as we are
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60756:118"/>able to Pay him? 'Tis an unſpeakable Favour, that God overlooks the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Imperfections of our beſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and allows us time and Grace for a Gradual Improvement; And this Goodneſs and Forbearance of God, if there be any Gratitude in us, any Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Senſe of the Infinite Debt that lyes upon us, will ſtrongly engage us to make the beſt Returns and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments we are able, knowing that <hi>when we have done all,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 17.10.</note> 
                  <hi>we are but <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitable Servants.</hi> And then the Danger of Forfeiting the Grace of God by our Wilful Negligence, and of Driving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Grieved Spirit from us, and ſo Clouding and Shortning our Day of Grace: How ſhould this Quicken our Diligence, and Inflame our Endeavours after Grace, to ſerve God in a more Lively and Acceptable manner, <hi>with Reverence and Godly Fear?</hi> But there will be an occaſion of enlarging upon this Argument in the Next Particular; which is this.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſtronger we Grow in Grace, the better we ſhall be able to hold out unto the End, without which all our Pains and Diligence in Religion will
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60756:118"/>be thrown away. A conſtant Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in Virtue, and Goodneſs is the beſt Security againſt Apoſtacy. While we go on and Perſevere in Well-doing, there is no Danger of our Falling away. All the danger is while we are at a ſtand, and are ſtrongly Tempted to Return to our former Courſes of Sin and Folly. By preſſing <hi>forward to the Mark, for the prize of our high Calling,</hi> we are continually getting ground for our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies: And the more we keep before them, the leſs Danger we are in, of being Surpriz'd and Overtaken by them. A State of Sin and Perfection being the two oppoſite Terms of our Chriſtian Courſe, ſo far as we advance towards the latter, we leave the former behind us, and by Conſequence are at ſo much the greater Diſtance from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy. So that, if we would ſecure our Perſeverance, it concerns us to get as Forward in Religion as we can, and not Reſt in any mean Attainments, as if we thought our ſelves at any time good enough for Heaven, and were ſure of our Crown, ſo ſoon as ever we had begun our Race. We know not what Tryals we may be Exerciſed with,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60756:119"/>or what degrees of Fortitude and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, we ſhall need to ſupport and carry us through them: But certainly 'tis a great Advantage to be well Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared before hand: And it therefore becomes us to be conſtantly Training and Exerciſing our Graces, and Daily Reinforcing our Reſolutions, to break through all the Difficulties that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our paſſage to Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If we Faint in the day of Tryal, we ſhall very hardly recover our ſelves: And if we fall away, we ſhall looſe all the Fruit of our former Labours, and <hi>our latter End will be far Worſe than our beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know there are thoſe that take ſanctuary at the ſuppoſed Impoſſibility of falling from Grace. I will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the Truth of this Doctrine; I will only remind thoſe who are too Fluſh and Confident of it (for ſurely it is too much for Man to venture his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon it) that tho it ſhould be true, it may do them no ſervice: And that for this plain reaſon, that many that have taken themſelves to be in a State of Grace, and had the Character of Good Men, amongſt thoſe that were
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60756:119"/>truly ſo, have at laſt yeilded to the Charms of this Tempting World, and Neglecting to <hi>Work out their Salvation with Fear,</hi> have Outlived all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their Good Eſtate, and the Fair Opinion of the moſt Candid and Charitable perſons. And for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we ſhould be extreamly Cautious of Preſuming too far upon the Grace of God, and Daſhing againſt the Rocks, which many that have had the Steerage of a Religious Education, and ſeemd to ſet out with all Advantages for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, have Fatally ſtruck upon, for want of that Diligence and Circumſpection, which is Requiſite in ſo weighty an affair as that of our Eternal ſalvation. There is no doubt, but that Good Men may Grieve and Reſiſt the Holy Spirit of God: And that every Degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance is a New Provocation to him, to withdraw his Grace from them: And that the oftener he is Repulſed, the more Danger there is of his Forſaking, thoſe that withſtand his bleſſed moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; And whether this may, or may not, proceed to an utter Dereliction, I am ſure we have all the Reaſon Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to be Cautious of it, Conſidering
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60756:120"/>the Dreadful End of ſome very Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Beginners: Who, if once they were not Really Good, were Deceived in themſelves: Nay, were ſo Extreamly like thoſe that are Good, that they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the beſt Judges of Sincerity and Goodneſs. <hi>Let him therefore that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he Fall;</hi> And let us all Endeavour, by a ſenſible and conſtant Improvement in Grace and Piety, to Grow <hi>Stedfaſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable, alwaies abounding in the Work of the Lord:</hi> And then we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, our <hi>Labour will not be in Vain in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Difficulty in Religion will Daily leſſen, and the Pleaſures of it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the farther we proceed in the Practice of it. The true Reaſon why any of God's Commandments appear Harſh and Grievous, is becauſe we are not uſed to obey it; For uſe and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence make any thing Eaſy, and all Excellent things Delightful. And hence we find by Experience, that the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer we do any good, the unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we are to come to it again: And the more faintly we ſet about it, the leſs ſatisfaction we have in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60756:120"/>of it. But now, let us but inure our ſelves to any part of our Duty, and take care to do it but as well as we can, and we ſhall quickly perceive, that we are pleaſed with what we have done, and that it is indeed but the ſame thing to Pleaſe God and our ſelves. A Good Man is never Weary of Doing Good: And it were ſtrange if he ſhould, for it is the Nature of Goodneſs to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all that deal in it; which, I doubt not, is the meaning of that ſaying of the Wiſe-Man, <hi>A Good Man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf.</hi> When he Prays,<note place="margin">Pro. 14.14.</note> or Meditates on Heavenly things with due Attention and Devotion, he is as it were in Heaven the while: And never Enjoy's himſelf more, than when he does any thing well which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of him. He that is hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to an Act of Charity, and at laſt does it but with half a Conſent, is fain to ſtruggle with himſelf before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds ſo far, and ſo loſes all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of it: Whereas he that gives freely and chearfully has no trouble in himſelf about it, but is highly pleaſed with what he has done, and finds it a <hi>more bleſſed thing to Give than to Receive.</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:60756:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>And thus, could I run through all the parts of Chriſtian Practice, I ſhould not doubt to gain this Concluſion, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in Religion would be Eaſie and Pleaſant, if it were but done as it it ſhould be; And conſequently, the more we improve, and the better we diſcharge our Duty, the faſter we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Difficulties of a holy Life, and make our progreſs the more eaſie and delightful to the End. This is no Romantick Fancy, but a ſolid and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereienc'd Truth. And how ſhould this animate our Endeavours, and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us in our ſpiritual courſe, that the better ſpeed we make, the leſs weary we ſhall be with our Journey? And that having paſt the firſt ſtages of it, if we do not loiter by the way, we ſhall gather ſtrength all along as we go, and be leſs tired than we ſhould have been by ſitting ſtill the while. Every ſtep will yield us a New Refreſhment, as it brings us nearer the glorious End of our Hope, and ſhortens the Diſtance betwixt us and Heaven.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, Let us conſider, that the better we grow, the fitter we ſhall be
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60756:121"/>to die, and the riper for Eternity. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very degree of Grace will help to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort us in our Laſt Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, when of all the hours we have to live, we would chuſe to have our minds eaſie and chearful, to be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of our Future ſtate, and to have nothing upon our ſpirits that may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion any bitter Reflections upon the Lives we have led, or any miſgiving Thoughts of our approaching Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When our Laſt and Determining Hour comes, we ſhall need all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which a ſtrong Faith, a vigorous Hope, and a perefect Patience, a good Conſcience, and a Holy Life can afford us, to vanquiſh the Fears, and ſupport us under the Pangs and Strugglings of Death, to make our Paſſage eaſie, and our Diſſolution deſirable. We are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally apt, when we perceive our ſelves upon the Brink of Immortality, to ſtand ſhivering at the amazing Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the boundleſs Ocean before us, being Naturally very loth to put off from this Beloved World, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very fearful of our landing upon the next. And there is nothing that can perfectly cure us of this Fear, but the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60756:122"/>lively Hopes of a better Life after this, through the Mercy of God, and the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, upon the Terms of the Goſpel-Covenant; <hi>i. e.</hi> our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Grace of God, and the Talents he hath intruſted us with. Such a Hope as this will charm our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Fears, Diſarm Death of its Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and make us even glad to die, and deſirous to ſee that happy World we have ſo long entertained our ſelves with the expectation of. We ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to give up our Accounts, if we have been <hi>Good Stewards, of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Grace of God,</hi> but rejoice that our <hi>Audit</hi> is at hand, being conſcious to our ſelves that we have been doing the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Lord, and <hi>that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the world.</hi> When we are going to God, it will be an unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort to us to be able to ſay, that vve have vvalkt before him in <hi>truth, and with a perfect heart, and done that which is right in his ſight.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 38.3.</note> And vvhat greater happineſs can vve imagine, or chuſe for our ſelves, than to ſail vvith a due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Mind, and a full Tide of Joy into a bleſſed Eternity?</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:60756:122"/>
               <p>If there are different degrees of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in Heaven, (as I think the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plainly intimates to us) the beſt men in this World vvill certainly be the happieſt in the next. And ſince there is glory enough there to crovvn all our Endeavours and Improvements, vvhy ſhould vve not aim at as great a ſhare of it, and to riſe as high in the grace and Favour of God as we can poſſibly attain unto? 'Tis certain, we cannot beſtow our time better than in laying up all the Treaſure that we can in Heaven; where we are ſure it will be ſafe, and will be always in a thriving and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, and where we ſhall find it (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few days) improv'd into <hi>an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore, having theſe mighty reaſons to quicken our ſpiritual growth, aſpire every day to exceed our ſelves, and to mend our progreſs in Religion. They that are but in an Infant-ſtate of Grace, have many ſtages and degrees to paſs through, before they can arrive at any great perfection; and ſo have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be preſſing on, leſt Time and Death ſhould be too haſty for them, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60756:123"/>not allow them ſpace to finiſh their Courſe with Joy. And for thoſe that are grown up to greater ſtrength and maturity, as better Fruit will be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from them than others, ſo it would be a real ſhame and prejudice to them to come behind themſleves, and that their laſt Works ſhould be worſe than their firſt. When all is ſaid to ſatisfie men concerning the goodneſs of their ſpiritual ſtate, aſſuredly the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and infallible Evidence of the Truth of Grace, is the growth and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of it. I ſhall conclude all with the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Wherefore, beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware leſt ye fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs; but grow in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> To him be Glory both now and for ever. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>

               <p>THe Precept in the Text was no Modern ſaying, no poſitive command of Chriſt, but one of the Ancient and ſtanding Rules of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion.

But even this, as it
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60756:124"/>was no leſs Authentick, was very Ancient too. Ye have heard (ſaith our Saviour to the Jews) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>it was ſaid to</hi> the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, or <hi>to them of Old time</hi> (for ſo the words are moſt naturally ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) <hi>thou ſhalt not Kill,</hi> That is, this Precept was delivered to their Fathers at Mount Sinai under the hand-writing of God himſelf, and was often repeated in after Ages by his Prieſts and Prophets. But it ſeems, it was not throughly Underſtood in our Saviours time, the Jews appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending themſelves clear of this Commandment, if they did not Kill and Murther one another. To recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy this great miſtake, our Saviour (being about to give them a larger and more perfect expoſition of the Law, than the Scribes and Phariſees, the famous Expoſitors of the Age, generally did) expreſly tells them, that cauſeleſs and reproachful An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is forbidden under the greateſt Penalties of this Commandment. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that whoſeover is Angry with his Brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

               <p>'Tis not my deſign at this time, to inſiſt upon our Saviour's Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſence of this Law, otherwiſe than the ſtating of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes may lead me to it: but to treat of that, which all the World are agreed, is the meaning of it; And the rather, becauſe the World has had time (and it ſeems, has been no ill husband of it) to wear off ſome of the very deepeſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this Ancient Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Scribes and Phariſees had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed run the people into many groſs miſtakes, and concealed the beſt part of their Duty from them, by their falſe and frigid Interpretations of the great Commandments of God. But,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60756:125"/>to do them right, they were much better expounders of this Law, than many of our Modern Chriſtians, who with Pens of Steel, and in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Bloud, are ready to juſtify, that Killing (for Honour) is no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And that it is rather an Act of Mercy and Prudence, than of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Diſobedience, when we are oppreſt with the Miſeries of this Life, to find the ſhorteſt Way we can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next, and to put an end to our Own Lives, when they are leſs deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than Death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Sentiments of Men of very different Complexion. The former are generally Men of Flame and Spirit, of a hot ſanguine Temper; which is ſeldom reckon'd the beſt Freind to a ſolid Judgment; The latter for the moſt part are of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Conſtitution, and while their Underſtandings are clouded with that dark Humour, muſt needs ſtand but in an Ill light to diſcern the Truth. But what ever their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in other matters, they ſeem to have clean forgot the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and moſt obvious meaning of

               <p>Which Precept, being expreſt in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few Words, will require the larger Explication: and the rather becauſe it is undoubtedly lawful inſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to Kill, and theſe muſt be known before we can certainly Determine wherein thenature of the hainous Sin of Murther conſiſts, which all men agree to be forbidden in this Law. For theſe Reaſons, in ſpeaking to theſe Words, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In what caſes it may be juſtly ſuppoſed, that Killing is not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is this law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What the Sin of Murther, or the Killing here forbidden is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherein the Hainouſneſs of this Sin conſiſts. And then I ſhall conſider.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether it be lawful or not, to Kill a Rival in a Quarrel of Honour: or to Kill our ſelves when we are grown weary of our lives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In what caſes it may be juſtly ſuppoſed, that Killing is not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in this Law. Life is the gift of God, which he beſtows upon us as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60756:126"/>a thing ſacred, to be preſerved for his Uſe, and not diſpos'd of without his leave and pleaſure.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7.</note> It is he that Breatheth into Man the breath of Life, and being abſolute Lord of it, there is no Queſtion but he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it when and by what Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he pleaſes. And that there are Crimes worthy of Death, both the Scriptures and Natural Reaſons do aſſure us. Yea ſuch Crimes their are, as, were they not ſometimes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with Death, would ſuddenly daſh all human Society in pieces, and bring the World into ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion that there would be no living amongſt men. And therefore it may be reaſoanbly preſumed, that Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not prohibited in all caſes. For inſtance,</p>
               <p>When a Magiſtrate puts an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to Death, that is worthy of it, in a regular courſes of Juſtice, he is not to be charged with the Breach of this Law. He has his Authority from God, the Spreme Judge and Sovereign Lord of Life and Death; He Acts as his Miniſter, by expreſs Commiſſion from him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60756:126"/>is Innocent of all the Bloud that is ſhed by the Sword of Juſtice, and hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Magiſtrate <hi>a Terrour to Evil Workers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3, 4.</note> becauſe <hi>he beareth not the Sword in vain, being the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him, that doth Evil.</hi> Nor hath God only given a General Commiſſion to Seize the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Lives of great and haynous Offenders, but in ſome caſes (as in that of the Murtherer himſelf) He particularly Commands the Uſe of this ſeverity, as a ſtanding Rule of of Equity and Juſtice [<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.] <hi>For who ſo ſhedeth mans Bloud by man ſhall his Bloud be ſhed.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <p>Killing in the Wars, when the cauſe is Juſt, and the War neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Preſervation of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, is no part of the meaning of this Law. For it is not to be ſuppoſed, that God who ſets up Kings and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments for the Defence of the common Safety, ſhould reſtrain them from Drawing the Sword of War, when there is no other means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. The Swords of Princes
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60756:127"/>are the greateſt Inſtruments of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the World: and the beſt and Nobleſt Uſe of them, is the Protection of their Subjects from Oppreſſion and Violence, in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all the Bleſſings of this, and the Advantages for a better Life, which the Bounty of Heaven, hath inricht them with. And therefore our Saviour never went about to tye the hands of Sovereign Princes, or States, from the uſe of this ſharp and laſt Remedy, in a Juſt and Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cauſe: nor was the Goſpel ever accuſed for being an Enemy to the Throne, upon this account. There being no Tribunal upon Earth high enough to decide the Quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Independent Governments and Nations, it is a natural and ſtrong Preſumption, when all ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ways of Peace and Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation fail, that God approves of the injured Party's Appealing to him in the Field of War, as the ſupreme Judge and Guardian of Right and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. And by conſequence, a Souldier that ſerves in a lawful War, is not forbid to Kill the Enemy of his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60756:127"/>Princes and Country: he is in this Caſes a Miniſter of Divine Juſtice, being inveſted with Authority from him, <hi>to whom vengeance belongeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are Publick caſes, in which the Authority of God over the Life of Man, is manifeſtly derived im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Sovereign, and by him to inferior Magiſtrates and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of Juſtice. Beſides which,</p>
               <p>It may be reaſonably preſumed, that when a private Perſon is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Aſſaulted, and in the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Defence of his own Life takes away the Invaders, he hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the Intent of this Law. Every man hath a natural Right to defend the Life which God hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him, againſt him that ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by unjuſt or Illegal Violence, to wreſt it from him. This alſo, as well as Life it ſelf, is the gift of God. It is a Debt we owe to the Lord and giver of Life, to keep it for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, till he is pleaſed to call for it, which he never do's by the hand of a Murtherer. And therefore when we are reduced to that Extremity, that we can neither Fly to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60756:128"/>Protection of the Magiſtrate, nor eſcape with our Lives with out tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Life of him that Aſſails us, if he Periſh in his wicked Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, his Bloud will not be Required at our hands, 'tis better for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to loſe a Bad than a Good and uſeful Member: and when the caſe is ſuch, that one of them muſt fall by the others hand 'tis reaſonable to ſuppoſe that both God and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Jutice do agree in the ſame choice, and by a virtual Commiſſion impower the Innocent Perſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their Vengenace upon the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to ſlay the Invader, rather than be Murthered by him. And this, I think, is the ſenſe of our Laws: and was ſo of the Roman; which allowed the Killing of a Thief in the day time, <hi>Si ſe telo defenderit,</hi> if he offered to make uſe of his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; And much more may we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon the lawfulneſs of ſaving our lives, when we are Aſſaulted with a Mortal Violence; and it is evident, after all our care to prevent and eſcape it, that unleſs we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately return it, there is but a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60756:128"/>Moment between us and Death.</p>
               <p>Theſe are all the ordinary caſes in which it is lawful to take away the Life of Man. There is one indeed of a more Heroical Nature, which has fair Pretences to the like Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from this Law: <hi>viz.</hi> When a Man is caſt into thoſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that either he muſt yield up the Life of his Friend (that is as his own Soul) or ſave it by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Enemys from him. But this Caſe is liable to ſuch infinite abouſes and variety of Circumſtances, that as the Tenderneſs of our Laws in this matter ſhews the Wiſdom of our Law-givers, ſo it is parhaps the beſt light that can be given into it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second thing was to ſhew, what the Sin of Murther, or the Killing here forbidden, is; by what hath been ſpoken it is eaſy to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that this Law Prophibits the bereaving our Neighbour of his Life without Authority, Juſtice, or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity enforcing to it. The Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which are, when a man of his own motion compaſſes the Death of another, in a wilful, Treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60756:129"/>Revengeful, or ſportive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: or is acceſſary to it at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of any Perſon not inveſted with competent Authority; whether this be done to cover our Shame, or to heal what we call our Honour, or with reſpect to any convenience, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or Advantage to our ſelves; whether we do this by open Aſſault and Violence, or by ſecret and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Craft: under the colour of Religion or Law; in the Face of the Sun, or under the Mask of Night; whether immediately by our ſelves, or by wicked Inſtruments, by Purju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Poyſon, by falſe Suggeſtions, evil Counſel or enticements, or any other Means or Method tending to the untimely Death and Deſtruction of our Neighbour.</p>
               <p>This is the Sin of Murther direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden in the ſixth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The firſt and immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of which, is to preſerve the Life of our Neighbour: which is generally of all other Bleſſings the deareſt to him, and ought to be highly valued, becauſe all the reſt of his enjoyments, and advantages of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60756:129"/>doing good (at leaſt) in this World do depend upon it.</p>
               <p>Now it muſt be ſuppoſed, that God, who forbids the Killing of our Neighbour, and expreſly Commands us to love him as our ſelves, does by conſequence alſo forbid the Killing of our ſelves. For we have no more Power over our own, than we have over the Lives of other Men.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one God Created us?</hi> nad hath he not Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated us after his own Image? the preſervation of which in Man is the manifeſt end and intention of this Commandment. But of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more fully under the laſt General.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next thing to be ſpoken to, is the hainouſneſs of the Sin of Murther. It is generally condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the voice of God and Men, as one of the greateſt ſtrains of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Inhumanity: and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a crime of the largeſt ſize, and the higheſt Provocation, of any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond Table of the Law. The very Relation of the Fact ſtrikes every Innocent Breaſt with Horrour,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60756:130"/>and raiſes a mighty Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Murtherer, The mean while his own Conſcience purſues him; and whither ſoever he flyes, his Accuſer, Witneſs, and Judge are with him, the Altar is no Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary to him; for God, who is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his Conſcience, hears the dreadful Cry of his Sin, ſtrongly importuning him to haſten down his Vengeance upon him. We have an inſtance of this in the firſt Act of this kind that ever was Committed: <hi>The Voice of thy Brothers Bloud</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Cain</hi>) <hi>cryeth unto me from the Ground, Gen.</hi> 4.10. And, 'tis obſervable, how quick and ſevere an Anſwer it received [11, 12. verſes.] <hi>And now art thou curſed from the Earth: a Fugitive and a Vagabond ſhalt thou be upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay the Malignity of this Sin is ſuch, that it difiles the Land where it is Committed, and leaves a guilt upon it, that is not to be expiated but by the Bloud of the Murtherer. And therefore no Sanctuary was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and if he fled to any of the Cities of Refuge,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60756:130"/>he was thence to be taken by the ſpecial Command of God, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately given up to Juſtice; <hi>Thou ſhalt take him</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>from mine Altar, that he may Dye,</hi> Exod. 21.14, and on this account God is ſaid to <hi>make Inquiſition for Bloud:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 9.12.</note> i. e. to ſearch out the ſhedder of it, and to drive him out of all his Refuge, till he fall into the hands of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Now ſince there is ſo terrible an outcry againſt the Murtherer: ſince Heaven and Earth are ſo highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens't againſt him, and ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to Puniſh him, there muſt be a more than ordinary Malignity and Provocation in the Sin, which calls ſo loud for ſo ſolemn a Vengeance. And wherein this conſiſts, will appear with the leaſt glance of our Thoughts upon theſe Tarticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it bids Defiance to the Majeſty and Authority of God, and in the nature of it directly tends to extinguiſh his Government in the World: It ſnatches the Sword of Juſtice out of his hand, and employ's
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60756:131"/>it to the Deſtruction of his Creatures and Subjects, contrary to his declared will, and moſt ſacred Prerogative. every time this Sin is puniſhed in its kind, two at leaſt of his Subjects are caſhiered out of the Land of the living, the Kingdom he hath Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongſt men.</p>
               <p>It is a peculiar affront to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, as it defaces the Image of God in Man, on this account it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the very greateſt Sacrilege, as <hi>Philo</hi> calls it: a robbing God of that Creature which he hath appointed to repreſent him in this lower World, which approacheth the neareſt in Perfection to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for his own ſociety, and of all his works hath the livelieſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Divinity upon it. And therefore, when God pronounceth Sentence upon the Murtherer <hi>[who ſo ſhedeth Mans Bloud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.6.</note> 
                  <hi>by Man ſhall his Bloud be ſhed]</hi> he aſſigneth this reaſon for it; <hi>For in the Image of God made he Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Murther is an Act of exceſſive Miſchief and Cruelty to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: the utmoſt wrong that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60756:131"/>aſſiſted with Rage and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, can do him. Life, beſides the the natural Sweetneſs of it, is the Foundation of all other Bleſſings, which we do or can enjoy in this World. It alſo gives us a bleſſed opportunity (and the only one we can have) of laying a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Eternal Life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be an inconceivable Damage to be wrongfully depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſo vaſt a Benefit, and hurried out of ſo dear an Enjoyment; to be ſtript Naked to our very Being and Eſſence, and turn'd out, perhaps in a Moment, into a miſerable Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This loſs can never be repaired, or ſo much as computed unleſs we could count the years of Eternity, or had certain knowledge of the future Eſtates of men, and were ſure that Heaven ſtood always open as a Sanctuary to thoſe, whom ſome men in their Rage and Madneſs judge unworthy to live upon the Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is an injury of vaſt extent in reference to the publick. It is the grief of all men that have any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels or tenderneſs of Nature in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60756:132"/>them, and a ſignal Prejudice to thoſe that are in Authority, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is robb'd of a Subject by it; his right of Judging and doing Juſtice between men, is violently aſſaulted and raviſhed from him. His Laws, the great Security of mens Lives and Properties, are broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; the Publick Peace, his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Charge and Province, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and violated; evil Men, ſo long as the Murtherer lyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, or in caſe he eſcapes the Law, are encouraged by his example to the like cruel and diſtructive Practices. This creates a diffidence in Men, makes them ſhy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful of one anothers Society. Beſides all this, Murther many times proves the Ruine of a worthy and uſeful Family, by taking off the Head, or lopping ſome or other of the more Hopeful and Flouriſhing Branches. All which Injuries do apparently tend to the diſſolution of the Publick Peace and Security.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we look to the Rice and Cauſes of this Sin, they are ſome of the greateſt Vices which reproach and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60756:132"/>vilify Humane Nature. The moſt common and viſible Cauſes of it are <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> which is the <hi>root of all evil,</hi> and the Counter-part of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: Luſt, the Mother of Shame: exceſſive Pride and Envy, which <hi>reſteth not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 4, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>unleſs it cauſes ſome to fall:</hi> a Cruel Deſperate, Malicious, and Revengeful Temper, fermented with helliſh Rage and Fury. Such are the Vices which prompt and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate men to this Savage and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Wickedneſs; than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more contrary to the Spirit of the Goſpel, which is all Kindneſs, Meekneſs, and Charity; nothing more unlike the Temper of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, his gracious Deſign in coming into the World, his pacifick Doctrine and Example to it, and his moſt charitable and obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of leaving it.</p>
               <p>This is a true Indictment of the Sin of Murther, which ſhews it to be a Monſtrous and moſt Hainous Crime: an Action entirely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely evil, with out the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a good Circumſtance in it. For a Chriſtian therefore, a Diſciple
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60756:133"/>of the Croſs, to be guity of it, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand (the Fatal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Horrid Fact) to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Right and Title to the Merits of him, who for our ſakes ſuffered upon it.</p>
               <p>And now, becauſe the great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and deceiver of Mankind, who was himſelf <hi>a Murtherer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 8, 44.</note> has found out wayes to palliate the hainouſneſs of this ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Crime, and betray Men into a preſumption of the Lawfulneſs of it in ſome Caſes,</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſhall, in the laſt place, more largely conſider theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> the Killing of another in a Quarrel of Honour; and putting an end to our own Lives, when we are grown weary of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Killing another upon a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge or Point of Honour, to ſatiate our Revenge, or to puniſh the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and Injuries which he offers to us. I cannot ſeriouſly think, that any man, while he is himſelf, I mean, while he is under the Government of Reaſon and hearkens to the cool Dictates of it, do's really approve of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60756:133"/>this, as a lawful and worthy Action. But it is far more incredible, that a Profeſt Chriſtian, that is competent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in the Doctrine of Chriſt, and Believes what he profeſſes, ſhould venture his Life and Salvation upon the credit of this Doctrine, That it is lawful to Kill the man that Affronts him. For unleſs we could hope to change the Natures of things, as eaſily as we do the Names of them, a voluntary taking away the Life of Man by a private hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority from God or his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Juſtice, is and will be the Sin of Murther to the Worlds End; And then it will be ſo, when we have dreſt it up with all the modiſh Names and flouriſh as we can put upon it. And the Killing an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in a Duel, for a ſcurvy Word or a rude Action, will be one of the deepeſt Stains of Honour, and an Act of the higheſt Injuſtice to our Neighbour, if the breach of the ſixth Commandment be ſo.</p>
               <p>When all is ſaid that can be, in favour of it, it is ſtill a private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon the Life of Man, which
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60756:134"/>God has impaled and reſerved to his own Uſe and Diſpoſal: forbiding all Perſons, but thoſe that Rule in his ſtead, or may juſtly preſume upon his or their Commiſſion, in any Caſe to touch or Invade it; And therefore to do it in Revenge of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, is a manifeſt violation of this Law: ſince neither God, nor the Magiſtrate, that bears his Authority, have made either of the contending Parties the diſpenſers of their Juſtice, but reſerved the matter to their own Tribunals. So that here the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, who gave the Affront of what Nature it was, or who ſent the Challenge? But the proper Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, who gave thee Power over thy Brother's Life? Who preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Heart-bloud as the only ſalve for thine Honour? And who is the lawful Judge and Revenger of the wrong thou ſuſtaineſt by him? And if the matter be put upon this Iſſue, I may almoſt leave it to every mans Conſcience to determine what the Verdict will be.</p>
               <p>For a private Man to Revenge himſelf in any kind, is <hi>Vti Jure alieno</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:60756:134"/>to uſurp another mans Right; which is always unjuſt: and then for one, in his ſtation, to invade the moſt ſacred Prerogative of his Prince to the deſtruction of his Subjects, muſt have all the degrees of Injury and Injuſtice in it, that can be eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: Beſides,</p>
               <p>To come to the Plea of Honour, the Life of Man is infinitely too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a thing to make Satisfaction for the little Affronts (and very little, God knows, they are many times) for which men challenge one another to Fight and Dye. It vaſtly exceeds all the Evil, which any man ſuffers by another in his good name. And ſurely, it is not like a Man of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or indeed of common Juſtice and Equity, to inſiſt upon a Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (as every one that engageth in a Duel do's) ſo extremely, in real Value, beyond the injury he ſuffers. And I verily think, I now ſpeak the unfeigned ſenſe of his own Mind, when he ſees his Rival groveling in his Bloud, when he reflects upon the ſad Trophies of his Killing Honour,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60756:135"/>and has ſurfeited himſelf with his unnatural Revenge.</p>
               <p>The Occaſions of Duelling are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, for the moſt part, to be either too ſmall and baſhful, or too ſhameful and reſerv'd, to appear in a Court of Judicature; But let the Calumny be never ſo foul, or publick, or ſo maliciouſly contrived, Nothing ſtains like Bloud: which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone ought to Reſtrain every man, that is tender of his Honour or Salvation, from ſhedding it, upon the higheſt Provocation that can be given him.</p>
               <p>But more than this, there are other ways of healing our Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and living in brighter Fame than ever, in the eſteem of the wiſeſt and beſt Judges of Honour; <hi>The Law is open,</hi> let the Parties Implead one another: Or if they muſt be fighting, let thy King and thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try bind the Lawrels of Victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thy Head, or Embalme thy Memory. This is certainly more Honourable then to Kill the worſt Man upon Earth in a private Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and makes the Caſe of Duelling
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60756:135"/>extremely different from that of one mans Killing another, when he is forſt upon it in his own Defence.</p>
               <p>And after all, I hope, it is no Affront to be reminded that we are Chriſtians: nor any diminution of Honour, to adhere to the Rules of our Holy Profeſſion. Great Spirits, as they are better fitted than others for great and excellent things,<note place="margin">

They have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very quick and piercing Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and are very lively in the management of the greateſt and moſt difficult Affairs; but are not always ſo happy in their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, (if I may ſo expreſs it) as to forget the injuries that are offered them, in Imitation of him who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave his Enemies, who forbid the drawing of the Sword in his own Quarrel, and expreſly told his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that he <hi>came not to deſtroy Mens Lives, but to ſave them.</hi> And ſince the Son of God <hi>ſuffered the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Sinners,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 9, 56.</note> why ſhould the Diſciple aſpire to be above his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60756:136"/>I am ſure, to Act contrary to the Author of our Religion, looks as if we were aſhamed of being thought his Diſciples; And if we are not, we cannot think it too great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, for his ſake and our own. To conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Pretence of Honour in the preſent Caſe, is apparently contrary to the Honour of our Bleſſed Lord and Redeemer, and the Rules he has given us to live by; If we believe him to be the Son of God, we cannot deny, but his Laws are of much better Authority than any of thoſe Rules of Honour, which ſome Men preſcribe to themſelves. Now our Saviour was ſo far from allowing men to Kill one another in a Quarrel, that he forbids all Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling and Provocation in Word or Action;<note place="margin">verſe, <hi>22.</hi> of this Ch.</note> and Repreſents the Danger of thoſe Liberties which men give to their Paſſions, tho' they proceed no farther than to Reproachful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to be no leſs than that of Hell-Fire. He alſo requires us to forgive our Brother,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.22, <hi>Ro.</hi> 12.19,</note> as often as he Offends; <hi>And not to revenge our
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60756:136"/>ſelves, but to give place unto wrath;</hi> and has taught us to Pray for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs at Gods hand, <hi>as we forgive them that Treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> Unleſs therefore, to Kill be to forgive, and to break Chriſt's Commandments muſt go for honouring him, no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can engage with Honour in a ſingle Combat: and I cannot Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine with what Succeſs he can hope to do it, while he Fight againſt Heaven and graples with one, who, he knew is infinitely ſtronger than himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is to fall greatly Short of the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, which our Saviour tells us (in the verſe immediately before the Text) unleſs we <hi>exceed,</hi> we ſhall <hi>in no Caſe enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> Theſe men (as I obſerved before) never denied, but that Killing a man, either in Hot or Cod Bloud, without Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was a Notorious Violation of God's Commandment. Nay to do this in Hot Boud, was in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion a Crime worthy of Death; as is plain in the Caſe of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> who
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60756:137"/>by their Law was ſentenc'd to dy, at the time of our Saviour's Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark,</hi> 15, 7.</note> for commiting <hi>Murther in the Inſurrection.</hi> And accordingly there was no Diſpute between our Saviour and the Jews concerning this meaning of the Law; And I heartily wiſh our fighting Gallants would conſider, whoſe Followers they are, and whether they alſo do not prefer <hi>Barabbas,</hi> before <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and under pretence of Revenging their own, lay his, with their own, Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Duſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For men to ſtake their Lives in a Duel, is to run the moſt deſperate hazard; I mean, of dying in a Sin, which ſeldom allows a few moments to Repent of it; or of Killing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Perſon, it may be their old dear and confident Friend; and perhaps eternally, by cutting off his time of Repentance, and making his Peace with God. He that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to Kill his Brother, whether he Kills him or not, mortally hates him; for he would be the Death of him if he could, and then I fear, he Forfeits ſomething more than his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60756:137"/>Honour that attemps it,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3, 15.</note> For St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>He that hateth his Brother, is a Murtherer; and we know that no Murtherer hath eternall Life abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him.</hi> And this being the Caſe of Duellers what a dreadful venture is it, to ſtake two precious Lives, and two Immortal Souls upon a mere imaginary point of Honour! If this be the Honour of Chriſtians, whoſe Religion (as St. <hi>James</hi> deſcribes it) is <hi>firſt pure, then peaceable, Gentle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 3, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without wrangling</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>and without hypocriſy,</hi> then let Light and Darkneſs embrace, and the plaineſt contradictions aſſume the Names of the brighteſt Reaſon and Truth.</p>
               <p>And now, I hope, it is worthy of a ſerious thought, whether this be not enough to ballance the mighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Honour. I know it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, that a Gentleman and a Man of Honour, ought not to put up an Affront, when it is in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Revenge it; But it is plain, that a Chriſtian of the beſt Rank and Quality ought to do this; and that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60756:138"/>great Men muſt be Judged by the Goſpel, whether they will think fit to Live by it or not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Caſe of Self-Murther, or caſting away our own Lives when we are weary of them. If we look to the Reaſon of the Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhall not Kill, viz.</hi> becauſe every man bears the Image of God, it is as plain a violation of it to Kill our ſelves, as to Kill any other man. And ſince we are commanded to Love our Neighbour <hi>as our ſelves,</hi> and the Love of our ſelves is the Standard of our Love to him, it follows that we have as great Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to the full, to be tender of our own Lives, as of his; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be Murther to Kill our neighbour, it muſt be at leaſt as great a crime to Kill our ſelves. Nay, in ſome reſpects it exceeds all the inſtances of Inhumanity and Vice, and tranſcends the moſt cruel and Crying Sins. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To Kill our ſelves is the moſt unnatural Murther that can be, if we conſider how deeply the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Self-preſervation is planted
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60756:138"/>in our Nature: and that it is a Law in our Minds, teaching us to abhor the Deſtruction of our ſelves, and to take the beſt care we can to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our own Life and Being, there can be no ſuch unnatural Murther as the putting of our ſelves to Death. There is no Natural Union in the World ſo dear and intimate as that of the Soul and Body; nor any that hath greater Intereſt depending upon it, both in reference to this and the Future State: And therefore nothing can be more contrary to the voice and dictate of Nature, than the wilful Diſtruction of it, by the ſame Perſon that is moſt nearly concerned to Preſerve and Enjoy it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is, of any Sin, the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the ſaving condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Repentance; which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for all other Sins, but this. Self-Murther is a Sin of that quick diſpatch, and that deſperate Nature, that it leaves a Man no time to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it. We may be Guilty of many other Sins, and may live to Repent of them: But he that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers himſelf, is fure to Dye in his
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60756:139"/>Sin, and to be hurried away in the Reek and Guilt of his own Bloud to the Tribunal of God, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing himſelf time to ask the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of it, or at leaſt to purge his Conſcience from ſo deep and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible a ſtain as this.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if we cannot be ſaved without Repentance, as the Goſpel aſſures us we can not, he that Deſtroys his own Life cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, becauſe he dyes in a Sin that cannot be Repented of. Tis true, God may have more Mercy for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners than he makes us acquainted with, (which may be juſt enough to keep our hopes alive at the Death of ſuch Perſons) but the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt Revelation of the Grace of God, it is an infinite Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in expectation of unrevealed Grace, to venture upon a Sin, which all the Grace and Truth that came by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is too little to ſecure the Forgiveneſs of.</p>
               <p>Theſe are great Aggravations of the Sin of Self-Murther. And I fear, the excuſes which are made for it
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60756:139"/>will prove no better, ſince they all center in a high diſcontent at the Providence of God. NO man offers to make away himſelf, that thinks himſelf well in this World: or that ſubmits to the Troubles and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which befall him, as coming from the juſt and overruling Hand of God. And for men to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Lives in a Pet, and to grow ſo utterly weary of them that they cannot endure to live a few day's longer, or wait for Gods Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Depart in peace, is</hi> a very high Reflection upon the wiſdom and goodneſs of his Providence: As if he had thruſt them into a World that was not <hi>fit for them</hi> to live in, as if hey knew better when, and how, to deliver themſelves out of the Miſeries of this Mortal Life, than he dos; As if God had no Regard to their Sufferings, or had left it to their diſcretion to leave the World, and diſcharge themſelves from his Service when they pleas'd; or had not provided a better World to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit them for it: As if an <hi>Eternal Weight of Glory</hi> was not a ſufficient
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60756:140"/>Recompence for their Patience under the heavieſt Afflictions of this preſent Life, which <hi>are but for a Moment.</hi> This is ſo falſe and inſolent a Charge againſt the Providence of God, that it is enough to ſpoil the beſt-deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Action in the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot excuſe ſo bloudy and unnatural an one, as Self-Murther is. I ſhall cloſe all with a caution or two concerning this deſperate &amp; unnatural Sin; and the rather, becauſe it has been obſerved by thoſe that have Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd into foreign Countries, that Self-Murther is far more common in this, than in any of the Nations about us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, let us be very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of thoſe Doctrines, which have occaſion'd many, and ſome very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, to deſpair of the Mercy and goodneſs of God and in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of their Souls, to fling away themſelves into the dreadful Abyſs of Eternity. There is no ground, that I know of, from the Goſpel to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God had no good-will to any particular Man from Eternity, and much leſs to the far greater part of Mankind; or that the Generality
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60756:140"/>of Men are bound over to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Iron Chain of an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Decree; or that Chriſt dyed to ſave but very few of thoſe that are called by his Name. And methinks the effects which theſe, and the like Doctrins, have had upon Poor Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Souls, ſhould be no Arguments to recommed them to any ſerious and impartial Judgment. We ought to be very tender of narrowing the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs of God, who would have all men to be Saved: Or laying the Damnation of Men upon any thing but their own wilful Opoſition to the Grace and Goodneſs of God, which <hi>leadeth to Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It concerns us to be very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all the methods and degrees of this Sin; Such as piercing our Hearts with worldly Cares, poiſoning our Health and ſurfeiting our Bodies with Exceſs, and Dying the Martyrs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance or Luſt. How many owe their Death to the Revels of a Night? Drink away their reaſon, and drown themſelves in Rivers of Wine? Game high, and when they have loſt their Money, or engaged their Eſtates, or
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60756:141"/>Honours, ſell their Lives to Redeem them? Theſe Men do as certainly Kill themſelves, and very often as ſuddenly too, as he that ſtrangles himſelf, or ſheaths the Fatal Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard in his ſobbing and deſpairin Breaſt. And is not this to <hi>Dye as a fool Dyes?</hi> without any conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Life he has led, or of the Everlaſting State he is launching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to!</p>
               <p>That man, that is not fond of Diſtruction, and in love wih Miſery, would venter his Life and Soul upon ſuch hazards as theſe? Were there no other Life than this, a prudent Man would not be prodigal of it; but to throw it away at one Caſt, or to ſtake it againſt the Pleaſure of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, when all Eternity depends upon it, is an aſtoniſhing inſtance of the Madneſs of Folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh that</hi> ment <hi>were Wiſe!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9.</note> 
                  <hi>that they underſtood this! that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their latter end!</hi> That in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their Souls, which muſt live forever, they would frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain themſelves with the ſerious thougths of Death, and Judgment,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60756:141"/>Eternal Happineſs and Miſery: and not ſuffer their Luſts and Vices to hurry them out of this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have any reaſonable hopes of a better, or have made any toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able preparation for it.</p>
               <p>There is infinite odds between a State of Hope in this Life, and of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Diſpair and Miſery in the next, <hi>where the worm dyeth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi> And then what a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thing is it to caſt away our Lives, when all our hopes &amp; intereſts in both Worlds do depend upon them? This is ſo wild and extravagant an Action, ſo contrary to all the dictates of Senſe and Reaſon, to the Rules of our Faith, and the foundation of our Hopes, to the very end of our Creation, the Honour and Goodneſs of the Divine Providence, and that eternal deſire of Happineſs, which is inſeparable from the Conſtitution of every rational Being, that there ſeems to be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple wanting in humane Nature to account for it. And can we be ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and unnatural, as to break thro' all the reſtraints of Humanity &amp; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and comply with the inſtigation
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60756:142"/>of the devil to deſtroy ourſelves, rather than ſubmit to the wiſe method of <hi>God</hi> to ſave us? Shall we Maſſacre our Souls and Bodies, which the Son of God did not think his own Life too dear a Sacrifice for? Shall we deprive our ſelves of all advantages for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Eternal Life, to gratify a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that never pretended to the leaſt degree of Pleaſure or Satisfaction in it.</p>
               <p>Let us make all the haſt we can to qualify our ſelves for the Glory and Happineſs of the Future State, there is no fear our time ſhould lye upon our hands: Death, without our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, will ſoon take it off and Eternity will require and diſerve the utmoſt preparation we can poſſibly make for it. Let us therefore be wiſe, and ſince through the Grace of God we may live and be happy, and weather out the ſtormes of this angry and tempeſtious World; let us <hi>poſſeſs our Souls with Patience,</hi> and value our Lives as one of the choiceſt Bleſſings of Heaven, and not <hi>Judge our ſelves unworthy of Eternal Life,</hi> by refuſing to wait for it <hi>all the days of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time till our change cometh.</hi>

               <p>THE Apoſtle in the Verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Text expoſtulates with a ſort of Proling and buſy Men, that were laying a long train of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to raiſe their Fortunes in the World, without taking any notice of God's Providence, or asking his leave to thrive and be happy; <hi>Go too now, ye that ſay, To day or to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we will go into ſuch a City, and

                  <hi>and Buy and Sell, and get Gain.</hi> As if he had ſaid, don't Reckon to faſt: You are ſure of nothing that you Count upon, nor conſider in whoſe hand your Life is, or on whoſe Pleaſure your fine Projects depend. You reckon as if you were abſolute Lords of Time; and had the World in a String, and could draw the Wealth and Traffick of it into your own Hands as you Pleaſe. You talk of great Matters, and are very Free of what is none of your own, while you diſpoſe of a Year to come: as if you knew the juſt Number of your Days, and were ſure your Lives would hold out as long as you have occaſion for them; <hi>Whereas you know not what ſhall be on the Morrow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note> Or what a day may bring forth. You may Sicken and Die, before to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row comes: Or you may finiſh your Journey, and Breath your laſt in the next Village, before you come to the City where your Deſigns are laid: <hi>For what is your Life? It is even a Vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:60756:143"/>
               <p>Theſe Words are a lively and emphatical Deſcription of the frailty and ſhortneſs of Humane Life. The Queſtion, <hi>What is your Life?</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> ſeems to propoſe it, to take down the confidence of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Men, implyes it to be next to nothing, a thing not at all to be Truſted or Relied upon: <hi>Alas what is your Life?</hi> And the anſwer leſſens it a much: <hi>It is a Vapour,</hi> a thin vagrant Fume or Flaſh, that rather appears, than ſubſiſts, and that but <hi>for a little time and then vaniſheth away;</hi> that is, It preſently ſinks into that Nothing (as to this World) which, wyile it appear'd, it was ſo little rais'd above.</p>
               <p>But the Life of Man in this World, as vain and ſhort as it is, deſerves his moſt ſerious Thoughts, becauſe there lies a mighty Weight upon it: no leſs than the concernment of a whole Eternity; And therefore the Shortneſs and Fickleneſs of it, are ſo far from excuſing a careleſs manner of Living, or Prompting us to Mirth and Jollity, as the onely Remedy againſt them, that they are very
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60756:144"/>weighty conſiderations to quicken our preparations for a better Life; and to excite us to the Well ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, ſince there is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be gained or loſt by the good or ill management of it.</p>
               <p>Our great hindrance to this Duty is, that we are very apt to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reckon our Lives, being willing to Believe they will laſt as long as we can invent Buſineſs for them, or Hope to find any Pleaſure in them. And for this Reaſon we need to be often Reminded of the ſhortneſs and inſtability of our Lives; For ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years as we Reckon upon more than we have to Live. We Borrow upon the Intereſt of the next Life, and are therefore like to pay dearly for them, and eſpecially ſince we can never enjoy them. We ſhall Live indeed to Eternity, but our ſtay here will be ſhort: and yet what we do for Eternity, muſt be done here in this World; and therefore it behoves us to take a right Meaſure of our preſent Being, and not think that our Lives will ſtretch, as our Fancies and Deſires of Living do.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60756:144"/>For tis plain, that the Stronger our Hopes of Life are, and the more Years we Reckon we have before us, the greater our Temptations will be to put off the main and neceſſary Work of our Lives, and to run the hazard of a too late and fallacious Repentance: of being <hi>Hardened by the Deceitfulneſs of Sin,</hi> and of falling at laſt into the ravings and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Dying Sinners, the ſad preſages of a miſerable Eternity. This we have often ſeen the Tryal of in Others, with that Ill Succeſs, that of all things methinks we ſhould not deſire to make the Experiment: which yet we cannot avoid, if we do as they have done before us, and ſuffer our ſelves to be Gull'd with the Flatteries of this preſent World into a Fond expectation of a long and happy continuance here. The ſureſt way to avoid the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this Fatal Errour, is to Underſtand the true State of our Lives, and to ſeaſon our Minds with frequent and ſerious Meditations upon it, that ſo we may apply them to the proper and great ends of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60756:145"/>Living. To aſſiſt you herein I ſhall do theſe two Things:
<list>
                     <item>1. I ſhall remind you of this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and important Truth, That the Life of Man in this World is very ſhort and tranſitory; And then,</item>
                     <item>2. Shew you what Practical Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences may be Drawn from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſhortneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability of our Lives.</item>

               <p n="1">1. The Life of Man in this World is very ſhort and Tranſitory. This is matter of ſenſe, and one of the moſt obvious Truths that ever Nature or Experience taught us. The Grave, every time it opens its mouth gives us a ſenſible Demonſtration of it; It ſhews us of what Mold we are made, what we are, and what we muſt ſhortly be. As ſoon as the vigour and gaiety of Youth are gone, before we come to the borders of Old-age we many times grow ſenſible of the the Decays of this drooping Life, and begin to feel our ſelves Wearing and Dying; And ſtill the longer we live and the wiſer and fitter we are to paſs our Judgment upon things, the more Apprehenſive we are of the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60756:145"/>ſhortneſs and fallacy of Life. Our firſt years indeed ſeem to paſs ſlowly on, becauſe they are the years of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, of curbing our Phanſies, and correcting our Errours: we are then commonly very eager in purſuit of Vanity, and we often meet with ſtops and interruptions in it from our Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Governors: and this makes us almoſt think that our time ſtands ſtill the while, and we ſhall never be our own Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our time, and the liberty to ſquander and throw it away as we pleaſe. But when once we have paſt the age of diſcipline, have had ſome experience of Life, and lived long enough to reflect upon the firſt Stage of it, we certainly ſee our miſtake, and chide time no more for not mending its ſpeed, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away ſo heavily from us. when we look upon the reverſe of our Lives, upon the years that are paſt, we have almoſt nothing left in view but the greater Sins and Follies we committed in them. Then, they appear but as a few days: then we are apt enough to ſay, how ſoon are
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60756:146"/>Twenty or Thirty years fled and gone? How inſenſibly are they ſlipt away? And were we to live twice as many more the Caſe would be the very ſame: and as ſoon as they are gone, we ſhould be at our old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint again, that our time in this World is very ſhort, and be ready to ſaywith good Old <hi>Jacob,</hi> (when he had lived neare twice as long as the Long-livers of our days generally <hi>Few and evil have the days of the life</hi> do) <hi>of my Pilgrimage been.</hi>

               <p>God has ſet us our Bounds which we cannot Paſs; and he has ſet them ſo near us, that it is ſtrange we ſhould Overlook them, or Dream of an Immortality here, while they ſtand ſo fairly in our View. <hi>The days of our Years</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt)
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60756:147"/>
                  <hi>are threeſcore Years and ten: and if by reaſon of Strength, they be four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years, yet is their Strength, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Sorrow: for it is ſoon out off, and we fly away.</hi> Pſal. 90.10. This was a mighty Fall, from the Age of the Patriarchs, before the Flood: after which the Life of Man ſhorten'd apace, till it came ſo low as Seventy or Eighty Years, which is now the ordinary Meaſure; and probably was ſo ever ſince the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs, at the Relation which the Spies brought them of the Land of Promiſe.</p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, that our Age is reduced to threeſcore and ten or fourſcore Years, we muſt not preſently Reckon that ſo many Years will come to our ſhares. We cannot promiſe our ſelves an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day, for <hi>we know not what ſhall be on the morrow;</hi> and therefore can make no certain Reckoning of it. All the time we can call our own, is that which we hve lived already; So much God has given us, and ſo much we muſt anſwer for, and we
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60756:147"/>cannot be ſure that he will give us a day more:
<q>
                     <l>Nemo tain Divos habuit faventes</l>
                     <l>Craſtinum ut ſibi poſſit polliceri.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Some are gone in a moment, from the Cradle to the Grave; and very many before they underſtand the conſequence of Life and Death: we Die many times when we think of nothing leſs, in the flower and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of our Age, before we have any Symptoms of Death upon us. But becauſe ſome there are that rub on to threeſcore and ten, or fourſcore Years, and very few that exceed them, ſeventy or eighty Years (at a moderate computation) may well paſs for the utmoſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod ofour Lives. This we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſteem a full Age, and yet when we Draw towards it, are ready to complain of the ſcantneſs and ſhortneſs of it. And if we think it ſhort when we ſee it drawn out to its utmoſt length, what are we to Judge of it, when it is cut ſhorter by forty or fifty Years than the ordinary Meaſure? What is the life of Children, who Die hanging
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60756:148"/>at their Mothers Breaſts? How ſhort is the Race of young Men, who expire while their Blood boils in their Veins, and yet have as deep an intereſt in Eternity, as the longeſt Livers upon Earth? But ſince the longeſt Life, by our own Confeſſion, is ſhort, I need not ask how little the ſhorteſt is to be accounted of.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay then, what need is there of this Diſcourſe? Why muſt we be taught a Truth, which we are ready to Seal with our Tears, and every time we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template upon, do ſadly bewail the certainty of? I anſwer, Tho it is evident that our Lives are ſhort, and we all pretend to know it, yet it is certain that our Memories are ſhort too; and that our fondneſs of this World is ſuch that we are apt to Forget where we are, upon what Terms we are here, how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly we muſt Remove, and what is Requiſite to procure us a ſafe and eaſy Paſſage into that Eternal World, where we muſt dwell in perfect Bliſs or Anguiſh for ever. We are ſo much enamour'd with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60756:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>World, that, like Paſſionate Lovers, we ſeem not to remember what we ſay or do while we are converſing with it; It fetters our Memories, while it captivates our Affections: And while it ſubdues our Hearts, it bereaves us of the beſt uſe of our Reaſon, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is to <hi>ſet our affections on Things Above,</hi> where we hope e're long to be: <hi>And not on Things on the Earth,</hi> where (were it worth our while) we are ſure we cannot ſtay long to enjoy them.</p>
               <p>This is our great Unhappineſs: It is the inordinate love of this World that makes us forget our ſelves, and the deſign of our Creator in ſending us hither; And the proper Remedy againſt it, is to keep our Minds as much awake as we can, with frequent and ſerious Thoughts, on the ſuddenneſs of our Departure hence. For it is not being of the opinion that our Lives are ſhort, when we hear a Diſcourſe about it, or follow a hearty Man to his Grave, that will cure us of our Dotage on preſent Things; Nothing leſs will
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60756:149"/>do this than a quick and laſting Senſe of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of our Lives. The power of Conviction laſts no longer than it is preſent to the Mind, or become habitual and familiar to it: as appears by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of thoſe ſolemn Vows, which Men commonly make in their Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (and which nothing elſe could extort from them) as ſoon as the Danger is over, and they begin to flatter themſelves with new Hopes, of a long and pleaſant Life.</p>
               <p>And therefore as Melancholy a Thought as it is, that our Lives are ſhort, beſides that it is never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, it is one of the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts that we can carry about us. For it is certain, we can never over come this flattering and enchanting World without it, and then we can never arrive to the Glory and Happineſs of that to come. As cold a Truth as it is, that we muſt ſhortly Dye, and leave this delicious World, it will mightily help to quicken our Devotions, and inflame our Affections to Heavenly things; It will thereby prevent a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60756:149"/>World of Sin and Folly: It will excite us to haſten our Repentance, to make the beſt of our little Life, and improve all advantages we hold by it, for a Bleſſed Eternity. And for theſe Reaſons, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture often recommends this ſerious Meditation to us: And to keep it freſh in our Memories, preſents us with great variety of affecting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, and lively Repreſentations of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of Humane Life: Such as are moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to our Senſes, and apt to raiſe a new Paſſion in our Minds, every time we think of them. For inſtance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Life is compared in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to things of the moſt tranſitory and fading Nature. St. <hi>James</hi> calls it a <hi>Vapour that appears for a little time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> Such is the Life of Mortal Men, even the Greateſt and Gallanteſt of them: It is up &amp; down in a moment: It is a Vapour very often in the civil, as well as in the natural ſenſe; and commonly the greater Oſtentation it makes, the ſooner it diſappears and is gone, and the Eye that ſaw
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60756:150"/>it ſees it not more. And on the ſame account it is compared to a Shadow, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.15. and to the Graſs and Flower of the Fields for its weak and fading Nature, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.15, 16. <hi>Verſ. As for Man, his Days are as Graſs: as a Flower of the Field, ſo he flouriſheth; for the Wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone, and the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall know it no more.</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> 14.1, 2. <hi>Man, that is born of a Woman, is of few Days, and full of Trouble: he cometh forth like a Flower, and is cut down: he fleeth alſo as a ſhadow and continueth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſhortneſs of Humane Life is repreſented by things that are ſmalleſt in number and extenſion in their Kinds. Thus the days of Man are ſaid to be <hi>like the Days of an Hireling:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 7.1.</note> Which are few and precarious in compariſon of thoſe which the Children of the Family enjoy in their Fathers Houſe; as our Saviour himſelf obſerves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 8.35.</note> 
                  <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant abideth not in the Houſe for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.</hi> And ſo the Pſalmiſt meaſures the Life of Man, by the breadth of his hand,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60756:150"/>which bears no proportion to the vaſt circumference of the Earth, or Heavens: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Thou haſt made my days as an Hand-breath;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39, 6.</note> Thou haſt encloſed my Life in a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Compaſs: And then he adds, as if he had ſpoken too laviſhly of it, and <hi>mine Age is as nothing before thee:</hi> A mere cypher or nullity, if compared to thy Eternal Duration; Whereupon he concludes, <hi>verily eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man at his beſt Eſtate is altogether Vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Life is alſo compared to things of the ſpeedieſt and ſwiſteſt Motion, to remind us that it is Haſtening away apace, and will be too nimble for us, if we delay the proper Work and Buſineſs which God hath aſſign'd us in this World. <hi>My Days</hi> (ſaith Job) <hi>are ſwiſter than a Weavers ſhuttle:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 7.6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Oh remember that my Life is Wind.</hi> We read in Scripture of <hi>the Wings of the Wind,</hi> which denote the wonderful ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; And ſuch is our Life: It is always upon the Wing: It makes all poſſible haſt to be gone; It keeps pace with the Wings of the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60756:151"/>Wind: It <hi>is a Wind</hi> (ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) <hi>that paſſeth away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.29.</note> 
                  <hi>and cometh not again.</hi> Our time is ever in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and always keeps the ſame ſpeed, what ever we are doing the while. And ſince we have but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, and that little (however ſpent) is always leſſening and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Period, it cannot be long e're the whole ſtock be exhauſted, tho' we ſhould Husband it to the beſt advantage, and live out (which perhaps not one of a thouſand do's) to the utmoſt ſtretch and poſſibility of Living.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſhortneſs and inſtability of this preſent Life is ſet forth by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions to things which are moveable at Pleaſure: Implying, that as ſhort as the ordinary Term of Life is, it is always ſubject to the Providence of God, and often leſſened by him in <hi>whoſe Hands our Times are.</hi> In this reſpect our Life is compared to <hi>a Shepherd's Tent,</hi> and our Bodies to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, i. e.</hi> Extempore Houſes or Receptacles, that are preſently ſet up and taken down, or removed at the Pleaſure of the Owner. And in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60756:151"/>this Language <hi>Hezechiah</hi> complains upon the ſad tidings the Prophet brought him of his approaching Death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 12. <hi>I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Reſidue of my Years: Mine Age is departed, and is removed from me, as a Shepherd's Tent;</hi> And this he immediately aſcribes to the ſpecial Hand of God, the Sovereign Lord of Life and Death: <hi>He will cut me off with Pining Sickneſs, from Day even to Night, thou ilt make an end of me.</hi> Thus alſo our Bodies are ſtyled <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> which are no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Habitations, no certain Dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-places; The Spirit that lodges within them knows they were never deſigned for its conſtant Abode and Reſidence: <hi>Knowing</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>that ſhortly I muſt put off this my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>even as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhewed me.</hi> We know theſe Sorry Tenements cannot ſtand long: We cannot tell how ſoon we may be Deveſted of theſe Earthly Bodies: but when Death comes to undreſs us, we certainly put them off, and very often before they are worn out with Age, or are almoſt ever the worſe for
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60756:152"/>Wearing. We have no leaſe of our Lives, but are every day liable to a Diſcharge: For tho' God hath ſet us a Term that we cannot paſs, yet he hath left it in his own Power to cut off as much of it as he Pleaſes, and accordingly our Lives are frequently much ſhorter than the common Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Life of Man is ſo very frail and ſhort, that it is reſembled to the vaineſt and moſt inſignificant Things. In Seripture it is ſaid to flee away <hi>as a Dream;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job,</hi> 20.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.20</note> a meer Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Fancy, which vaniſhes at the chace of a waking Thought, and is nothing but Ramble and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction when the Mind recovers the ſcatter'd Ideas of it. The Pſalmiſt alſo compares it to the <hi>Telling of a Story,</hi> Pſ. 90.9. <hi>We bring our Years to an End, as it were a Tale that is Told.</hi> As we are talking and jeſting Death intrudes into our Company, and our Life is gone in a Trice, <hi>dicto Citius,</hi> before we can bring out the ſaying we were upon; or as ſome Paraphraſe the Words recording to the <hi>Arabie</hi> Verſion, our Years are reputed as a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60756:152"/>Spiders Web, whoſe curious Frame and Contexture ſignifies nothing to its own preſervation, having no ſtrength or ſolidity to ſupport it.</p>
               <p>By ſuch familiar Emblems as theſe do's the Spirit of God, in whom, we live, breath, and have our beings, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us of (what we are very apt to Forget) the frailty and uncertainty of this preſent Life. And this it do's to cure us of our Heat and Paſſion for this World, and the great Vanity of reckoning upon time to come, which at preſent we are ſure is none of ours, and perhaps never ſhall be; and to excite and quicken us to ſecure our everlaſting Intereſts, and to take care of the whole compaſs of our Beings, of which the longeſt Life in this World is a very ſmall and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portion. And as this ſhews the great concernment of our Creator for our well-being and happineſs, ſo it is reaſonable to think that the thoughts of it ſhould ſtir and affect our Minds: and that while we are hear we have but a ſhort time to live, we ſhould be willing to underſtand the beſt way of Living and Dying, of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60756:153"/>making a good hand of this preſent Life, and of ordering our Steps as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves thoſe that Tread upon the Brink of Eternity.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Second Thing propoſed, which was to ſhew what practical Inferences may be drawn from the conſideration of the ſhortneſs and inſtability of our Lives. And as unpleaſant as this Argument is, if we will but deal faithfully with our ſelves, &amp; impartially weigh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it, I doubt not but we may learn a great deal of Wiſdom from it, both for the regulation of our Lives, and reconciling our Minds to the ſhortneſs of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, we ſhould hence learn to lay aſide all expectation of meeting with true and real Happineſs in this World. For true Happineſs is the moſt conſtant and durable thing that can be: And then we may be ſure that the Happineſs of this World, from which we muſt part ſo ſoon, and without which we muſt live a whole Eternity in the Other, is not true and proper Happineſs.</p>
               <p>We come into this World to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60756:153"/>not to court or enjoy it; ſo long as we are converſant with it, and lye upon its border's, it will be always tempting and troubling us: ever and anon preſenting us with new occaſions of ſhewing our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and improving our conqueſt over it; and till we have compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Victory, we cannot expect our Triumph. And it is well for us that our Triumph is not aſſign'd us in this World, where the greeneſt Laurels do quickly Fade; and the Head that wears them is ſoon laid in the Duſt. Now let us digeſt this Principle well, that this Life is not a State of Reſt and Happineſs, and it will ſurely cool our Affections to the preſent World, and ſave us a great deal of trouble and vexation in perſuing the Vanities of it: for, that is the proper Name of things, which appear but for a little time, and then vaniſh away. And this is a good ſtep towards a diſcovery of the Place and Nature of Happineſs, and engaging our Minds in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of it. Here it is not to be found, and therefore I muſt ſeek for
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60756:154"/>it in the next World, where I ſhall dwell for ever, and where all things are firm and everlaſting. And ſince it lyes not in fading Pleaſures, or in any of the periſhing delights of fenſe, I will look for it in things of a better and more permanent Nature, in Spiritual and Divine Enjoyments; I will expect my happineſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only as the place, and in God as the Fountain of it. And let the World ſmile at me for this (as it is like it will:) my Life will be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly gone, and 'tis my Intereſt to make the beſt of it that I can, and much better to be jear'd into Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, than decoy'd into Miſery.</p>
               <p>Thus, as the Shortneſs of our Lives is a plain Argument that we are not capable of being truly Happy in this World, ſo the ſerious conſideration of it will both leſſen our eſteem of its Delights and Treaſures, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move us to aſpire after a more laſting and bleſſed State. And this was it that made thoſe excellent Men (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 11, 16.) who <hi>confeſſed that they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth</hi> (here to day,<note place="margin">verſ. 13.</note> and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60756:154"/>gone to their Everlaſting home) deſpiſe this Worlds tranſitory Glory, and <hi>deſire a better Country, that is an Heavenly;</hi> a more aſſured and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during State, a place of undiſturbed Reſt and Joy, of endleſs and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The conſideration of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uncertainty of our Lives, ſhould ſilence our complaints, and comfort us under the greateſt Evils and Troubles that are incident to us in this World. The Miſeries of this preſent Life; beſides, that they are Checquer'd with innumerable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, cannot be very great, becauſe they muſt be ſhort, and a little time and patience will eaſe us of them. Many of them are but <hi>

And ſuch are our Wants of all the unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things of this Life; we fancy we ſhould live more pleaſantly, if we had more Eſtate, or more Power
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60756:155"/>and Applauſe in the World; and it may be, we ſhould live worſe than we do, and not ſo long as we may do without them: For we ſee that few Men that have them, have vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue enough to make a good Uſe of them, and that the Eſtate and the Owner do very often help to Ruine one another. And for thoſe Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are real, and we cannot but feel the ſmart and inconvenience of ſuch, as Sickneſs, Pain, Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Oppreſſion; if they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, they are worth a Complaint: if exceſſive and inſupportable, they cannot laſt long without mixtures of Eaſe and Comfort, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear them long. The ſharper they are, the ſooner will they cut our way through them, and let in Death to releaſe us from them.</p>
               <p>And this comfort we have from the ſhortneſs of our Lives, that there is a ſure Remedy at hand againſt all our Maladies, againſt all the deſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es we contract in this unwholſom Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and the inconvenience we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in this troubleſom and uneaſy World. Muſt I ſhortly Dye? Why
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60756:155"/>then I ſhall quickly have eaſe, and in a little time ſhall never be Sick more; after that, I ſhall no more complain of reſtleſs Nights and tireſom Days: I ſhall Sleep ſecurely under the clods of the Valley, and never mind what the buſie and ungoverned Rout, or the Malicious and Cenſorious World will be ſaying of me, I ſhall no more be griped with Oppreſſion, or pincht with Want, or ſtung with Reproaches, or diſturbed by the Folly and Madneſs of the people.

               <p n="3">3. Since our Lives are very ſhort we ſee what a fair propoſal God is pleaſed to make us, when he promiſes Eternal Life upon the ſpending of theſe ſhort Lives in his Service. What greater offer can we deſire? Or what better Advantage could we hope to make of our time, if it were at our own diſpoſal, and there lay no other obligation upon us to employ it in God's Service? We cannot but ſay, that Religion teaches us to make the beſt uſe of our time, becauſe it
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60756:156"/>teaches us to live like Men, in a due ſubordination to our Maker, and to do the beſt things for the World, and for ſelves, which is the Glory and Perfection of our Nature. But ſuppoſe, it were poſſible for us to be diſcharged from this Obligation to a Life of Virtue and Religion, or that we might ſafely break it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing the diſpleaſure of God upon us, yet ſince Heaven is Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us upon this condition, that we live <hi>ſoberly, Righteouſly and Godly,</hi> for the little time we have to ſpend in this World, how is it Poſſible that we ſhould refuſe it, when we have the proſpect of ſo glorious a Reward, and may be ſure to be completely Happy ever after? Again, ſuppoſe Religion had no Temporal Promiſes to invite us to it, and (which is the utmoſt that was ever Pretended againſt it) ſuppoſe it were a tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thing to ſpend our lives in the Service of God, and to be tyed up from the liberties which humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo ſtrongly deſires, yet ſurely when Eternal Joys are ſet before us, we may well endure the uneaſineſs of it, and chearfully diſpence with a
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60756:157"/>ſhort trouble to poſſeſs our ſelves of Pleaſures for evermore. Alas, what is this little Flaſh of Life, when thou look ſt into a vaſt Eternity, and are invited into a State, of endleſs Bliſs and Glory? When it is almoſt ſpent, we generally complain that it is quickly gone; and they that have ſpent it beſt, are beſt pleaſed with themſelves, and are only troubled that they have not ſpent it better; and if they had a hundred lives more they would not chuſe to ſpend one of them in the Service of Sin, or on any account to want the comfort and Satisfaction which they find in ſerving and pleaſing God. Many of them have thought Heaven a cheap Bargain at the Price of Martyrdom and Perſecution, and gladly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac't a Stake, rather than enjoy <hi>the Pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon.</hi> And certainly the teſtimony of good Men, who have made Religion the buſineſs of their lives, is far more credible than theirs, that never had the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to examine its Principles, or to make any competent Tryal of them.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, if we ſubſtract all that time which God allows us to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60756:157"/>provide for our ſelves and Families, to refreſh our Bodies with Food and Reſt, and other lawful Diverſions, to ſerve and enjoy our Friends, and exchange good Offices with our Neighbours and Acquaintance, which for the moſt part paſſes away plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly enough with us, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our Life is ſo ſmall, that we may be aſhamed to grutch the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting of it to our great Benefactor, at whoſe pleaſure it is whether we ſhall live a moment or not. After all, were the Duties of Religion every where as ſharp and difficult as ſome men eſteem them, yet ſurely they are much eaſier than Eternal Torments, and it is nothing ſo irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to ſerve God, as it is to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and if we think ſo, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but allow that the ſpending a few years in his Service, tho' it ſhould prove a Pennance to us, ſince we may both eſcape the Damnation of Hell, and enjoy the Happineſs of Heaven by it, is ſo fair a demand; that nothing can ever excuſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſhortneſs and inſtability of our lives ſhould teach us to moderate
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60756:158"/>our Cares about earthly things, and ſubmit all our deſigns and purpoſes to God's good Pleaſure and Providence over us. 'Tis a ſtrange Abſurdity, which the over-buſie and deſigning Men of this World are Guilty of, that they love it better than their lives, tho' all their enjoyment of it depends upon them. They complain that their lives are ſhort, and yet ſell them very cheap to purchaſe a little Eſtate or Honour; and wear them out much faſter than they need to do, by immoderate Toyal and Labor, only to have a Name for leaving ſomething behind them. To Dy Rich, they Kill themſelves with piercing and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cares, and have hardly the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Fool in the Goſpel, to eaſe and refreſh their Souls, tho' they have <hi>goods laid up for many years,</hi> and ſcarce know where, or on whom to beſtow them. And methinks of all Perſons, ſuch Men ſhould not Taxt the Providence of God, for allowing them ſo ſhort a time in this World, ſince they take ſo much pains to ſhorten it themſelves, and cannot afford to live out the time which God and Nature have allowed them. On
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60756:158"/>the other hand, where is the wiſdom, ſeeing our lives are ſo ſhort, of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long Train of Deſigns reaching into Future Ages, and promiſing our ſelves ſucceſs upon any little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from the preſent Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Affairs, when it is impoſſible we ſhould live to ſee, or be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently aſſured of the concluſion of them? Who that reads <hi>Campanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Monarchy, can forbear to ſmile at the ſimplicity, or admire the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of crowing Mortals, who undertake to govern the World in future Times, and inſtruct the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God how to demean it ſelf in relation to them? 'Tis too much for a mortal Man to undertake for the events of a ſingle day; 'tis very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for him to trouble himſelf and the World with Projects which are never like to take effect in his days, and nothing is more abſurd; than to brag what great things he will do at ſuch a time, which it may be, proves to be Ten or Twenty years after he is gone to his Grave. St. <hi>James</hi> having to do with ſuch men, teaches them (immediately
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60756:159"/>after the Text) to expreſs themſelves in a more Modeſt and Chriſtian Style: <hi>For that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will, we ſhall live, and do this or that.</hi> Since your Projects depend upon your Lives, and your Lives upon God, you will do well to take him into your Counſels, and propoſe none but reaſonable and moderate things, always ſubmitting your ſelves and them to his Wiſdom and Conduct: to leave Future Time and Events to God's over-ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to do your preſent Duties, and not intereſt your ſelves in the World any farther than you may be ſerviceable to it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Conſideration of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Lives, and the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability of them; ſhould engage the youngeſt of us to begin them well, and to uſe all the care and Frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they can in the ſpending of them, leaſt they ſhould not hold out for the great purpoſes of Living. While we are young we are as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Virtue and Religion, of Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and going to Heaven, as when we are Old. All theſe things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our Happineſs, and as much
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60756:159"/>our concernment now, as ever they will be; all the difference is, that Youth is the beſt, and perhaps the only opportunity that a young Man will ever have of being good and happy. Old-AGe is no neceſſary part of Huamen Life; there are more that Dy young, than that Live to be Old; and of thoſe that do ſo, there are few that live well, that did not begin to live betimes; I mean, that had not an early ſenſe of God and Religion.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore, you that are young, how much it concerns you to make Religion your firſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate care, if you would aim to do the moſt neceſſary and important Work of your Lives to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. You will be ſure to eſcape two mighty Hazards by it: <hi>viz.</hi> The Danger of Dying Young, which is over when you are fitted for Heaven by an early Piety: And that of deferr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Repentance till you are Old, or you know not when; which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom comes to any Thing, or at moſt but to a deep and piercing Sorrow that you did not Repent ſooner, when you had Life and Quickneſs of Thought, Opportunity and Ability
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60756:160"/>of ſerving God, and laying a good and laſting Foundation for Eternal Life. And then by conſecrating your green and blooming Years to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, you will have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of making the moſt of a ſhort Life; You will ſoon find the ways of Religion pleaſant, and the pleaſantneſs of them will engage you to Perſevere to the End, which will be everlaſting Life, and Pleaſure for evermore. By ſetting out early towards Heaven, and taking the morning of your Days, you will find it a much eaſier Journey than they generally do, who thinking to Ride it off in a few hours in the Evening, are ſoon benighted and forc't to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel without any certain Guide or Light, till they ſtumble into a Dark Grave, and a doubtful Immortality. And ſhould you live but to a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Age, yet beginning Young, and making the beſt Improvement of your ſhort Time, you may do very great and eminent Things for God's Honour and your Own, and the good of Humane Society; For your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in this, and your Happineſs in the other World; And ſo may live
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60756:160"/>more in your little time, than they that live longer by many Years, than the late Evening Convert, or the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is an hundred Years Old. For indeed we are not properly ſaid to Live, till we are alive to God and our Redeemer, and begin to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven and Eternity, which are the proper and great Ends of Living. And therefore, if we would make the beſt of our Time, as we had need to do that have ſo little in Store. We muſt begin at the right End, and Engage betimes in the Service of God, and not think it enough, when we have ſpent the Flower of our Age upon His and our own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enemy, to put him off with a few of our blaſted and wither'd Days, <hi>in which we have no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and can have no Reaſon to think they ſhould be acceptable to Him. And for the ſame Reaſon, it concerns us, having begun well, to hold on in the ways of Vertue and Piety, and to get as forward as we can towards Heaven in the next Stage of our Lives; remembring that our Lives are now ſhorter than they were, and that our Time is every day more precious than
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60756:161"/>other, the value of it improving as the Stock Decreaſes: That nothing leſs than our Progreſs in Well-doing can ſecure our hopeful beginnings: That every good Work we do, will both help to inſure and enhance our Reward; and that the true Way of lengthening our Time, is to Live it all, and apply it to the uſes of a Bleſſed Eternity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, This ſhould admoniſh thoſe, that in a Courſe of Nature are drawing near a Concluſion of their Lives, and have been long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the Affairs and Buſineſs of this World, to haſten their Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Better. Such Perſons need not be taught, that having lived fifty or threeſcore Years already, their Lives are ſhorter than they were by ſo many Years, and therefore in Reaſon they cannot think to live many more: and then, it is to be Hoped, the little Time that is left is not too much for Heaven. If we think it is, I cannot imagine with what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we can entertain any Hopes of going thither: And if we think not, why do we not follow our own Convictions, ſtrike off immediately
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60756:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>from this World; and gain all the Time and advantage that we can to Purify our ſelves from all Pollution of Fleſh and Spirit, to Adorn and Beautify our Souls with Divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces, and qualify them for the bbleſt Society of God, and the glorious Spirits that are about his Throne?</p>
               <p>We have lived to little purpoſe, if all this while we are not ſenſible of the Vanity and Fallacy of this World, and muſt have very mean apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Celeſtial Bliſs and Happineſs, if we can but ſo much as deſire to live always here; However it do's not lie at our choice; We may chooſe whether we will be Happy or Miſerable in the other World, but thither we muſt go, and one of the two we muſt certainly be: And ſince we are ſo far upon our Way, it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns us, if we make Heaven our Option (and it is ſtrange if we ſhould not) to be very quick and ſerious in our Preparations for it.</p>
               <p>They that have loſt all, or the beſt part of their Time, have none to loſe now, unleſs they will loſe all Eternity with it. And for thoſe that have met
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:60756:162"/>with great interruptions in their Chriſtian Courſe, having been hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up and down by the Affaris and Buſineſs of this World, it behoves them to get out of the Noiſe and Buſtle of it, ſo ſoon as ever they can, and to redeem the precious Hours and Opportunities they have loſt of ſerving God, and laying up their Treaſures in Heaven, tho' they ſhould Dye ſome hundreds the poorer for it. For ſurely the next Life is of far greater concernment than this, and therefore it becomes the beſt Men, when they have had their ſhare of the Trouble and Buſineſs of this World, and have enough to carry them through it, to retire as faſt as they can, not merily to enjoy their Eaſe, but as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Caſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Men that Traffick in a Forreign-Land, have generally the Wiſdom to withdraw their Effects, when they are leaving the Country, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Native Soil. And 'tis ſaid of the Holy Men, mention'd, that <hi>they declared plainly,</hi>

And what leſs can we do to teſtify the ſincerity of our Chriſtian Profeſſion, who renounce the World in our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, than freely to take our leave of it, ſo ſhort a time before we go to our Graves?</p>
               <p>In ſhort, 'tis high time, when we are upon the confines of the other State, and can ſee Eternal Life Juſt before us, to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage our ſelves from the Diſtractions of this buſy World, and to gain leiſure before we Dye, to compoſe our Spirits, to perfect our Repentance, and to fetch off the Soil and Defilement we have contracted
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60756:163"/>in the hurry of our Wordly Occaſions, or by keeping too much upon the common Roads. Men eſpecially, that have run through a World of Buſineſs, muſt have borrowed much Time from the Hours of Prayer, and other Religious Duties; and ſhould therefore make ſome kind of Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution by giving their laſt Days to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Service of God, and not venture to go reeking out of this World, with a ſteam of Earthly Affections about them, into his immediate Prefence.</p>
               <p>To conclude, ſince <hi>the Time of our Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is at Hand, What manner of Perſons ought we to be in all Holy Converſation and Godlineſs? Looking for and haſtening unto the coming of the Day of Chriſt, the Glorious Day of our Redemption from Death, and Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all the Enemies of our Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> Let us therefore bid adieu to all the flaſhly Delights and Impertinent Cares of this Tranſitory World: Let us lay aſide every Weight that beſets us, and fix our Converſation in Heaven: Let us raiſe our Spirits, and lift up our Heads with Joy, in Expectation of the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile Body, and make it like unto glorious Body, by His Mighty Power, which is able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all Things unto himſelf; To whom with the Father and Holy Spirit, be Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed all Honour and Glory, Dominion and Power, both now and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
